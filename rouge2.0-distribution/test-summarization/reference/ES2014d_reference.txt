the first prototype for the remote control was made of singlecurved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons some of them in a slideout panel with a cherry design on top
it uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition
the initial cost was calculated at 1370 euros
although over budget the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes
on a scale from 1 true to 7 false they rated it on the basis of the following criteria fancy design 2 technological innovation 2 ease of use 1 incorporation of fashion elements 2 and brand recognition 2
changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra buttonform and colour
the team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed
however the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting especially since the requirements restricted it to tv only and the budget was too small
finally some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition
the team have two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting to complete before they finish
the remote will be singlecurved with a cherry design on top
the case will be made of plastic
the buttons will be made of rubber mostly in a light blue colour
however volume and channel buttons will be different from the rest
volume buttons will be lemonshaped and coloured
a slideout panel with extra buttons for lessused functions is included
the buttons in this panel will all be in the standard blue colour
a simple chip is going to support the electronics of the device
a sample sensor was included to add speech recognition
the remote is going to be powered by kinetic energy
after changing the case material from rubber to plastic it was debated that the loss of sponginess does affect the fancy appeal and trendiness of the remote
on the other hand it was argued that the special colours and form compensated for that
the team were not certain to what extent the prototype satisfied recognisability of the corporate identity
they were not certain what the colour of the company logo should be and how the logo should be displayed
