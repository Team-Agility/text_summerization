the project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting
the interface specialist begins her presentation by highlighting important remote functions and showing examples of remote interfaces
the group comments on her presentation and then the industrial designer begins presenting
she talks about the technical electronic components of the remote explains how a remote works and shows a few pictures revealing the insides of a normal remote control
she suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable using a rechargable battery and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip
the marketing expert presents talking about user preferences for a small simple eyecatching cute appealing and functional remote
fruit and vegetable shapes are popular this year so a soft spongy remote perhaps covered with cloth could make the item marketable
the group discusses the issues surrounding speech recognition noting that if it is good quality it could be costly
they about the power source and review the objectives of the product
the project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete
the marketing expert will do the product evaluation
the industrial designer and interface specialist will work together on a prototype using modeling clay
the industrial designer will come up with a user interface design
their coaches will send specific instructions and answer questions
they decided that the product should be bright colorful trendy in design strong compact have push buttons and contain supplement features possibly mute button swapping button voice recognition
the power source will be batteries because it is costeffective
they will have the industrial engineer do more research on the cost of voice recognition before deciding whether to include that function
the group would like to include voice recognition as a feature but they are not sure about how much it would cost
this will require further research by the industrial engineer
