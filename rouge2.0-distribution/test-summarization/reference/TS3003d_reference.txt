in the detailed design meeting the team created a prototype
along with buttons for numbers channel selector volume mute onoff teletext and subtitles the prototype included an lcd screen and a help button for functional information
one rechargable battery singlecurve form and plastic case brought the total cost to 17 euros
to reduce this cost it was decided to replace most buttons with a scrollwheel
the remaining buttons were one for channel selection one for volume both assisted by the scrollwheel teletext onoff and the help button
a suggestion to target the product to a younger or perhaps more general group was met with approval
all these components were rearranged in a revised prototype
it was evaluated on a scale from 1 to 7 on the basis of the following criteria fancy design 6 technological innovation 4 functionality 7 consideration of the target group 3
the remote was also recognisable as a fashionable real reaction product
the project process was deemed wellstructured although everyone thought it would have been better had they known the component prices at an earlier stage
teamword and leadership were good but room for creativity impeded by budget constraints
the project manager will prepare the final presentation while the rest of the group will fill in a questionnaire
the prototype will use a rechargable battery
the case will be plastic and will be made in singlecurve form
five buttons are going to be used one for channel selection one for volume both assisted by the scrollwheel teletext onoff and help button
these would be made of rubber in a colour different from that of the case
their functionality will be enriched by the use of a scrollwheel going up or down the channel list changing the volume etc
standard buttons like the ones for teletext shortcuts were considered superfluous
an lcd screen will be providing functional information and context tips when using the scrollwheel
the revised prototype will probably be targeted to a younger one or even across the population
the final cost of the prototype was probably slightly over the specified 1250 euros
raising the budget was not an option although it was promoted as an idea throughout the meeting
it is not clear whether the budget will allow for a docking station to be produced along with the remote as it isnt included in the costing sheet
the nonstandard interface few buttons scrollwheel makes the remote unsuitable for older people the original target group
it was suspected that many would not know how to use a scrollwheel even though it does resemble a radio tuning button
