complicated functions will be hidden in a back panel
all participants will continue working on the remote functions
the remote will feature a locator function that responds to clapping
there will be a device that allows the user to enter two numbers separately to get a twodigit number in order to reduce the overall number of buttons
the remote will feature a panel that hides complicated functions on the back of the device
buttons to adjust picture quality channel tuning and other settings will be hidden in this panel the number pad the channel and volumechanging and power buttons will remain on the main interface
