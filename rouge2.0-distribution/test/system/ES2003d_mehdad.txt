rubber , it turned out that the only end of the uh of the rigid substructure .
point uh have a list of criteria , that 's still part of the design .
've got the use of the L_C_D_ . Um .
idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well ,
's more a case of fruit and veg , buttons . Um .
price we had to get this in , to have a positive you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , four , five , six , seven .
n't full of ideas , considering the report that we 've got is room for creativity . As much as can be leadered in this uh thing .
've got the use of the L_C_D_ .
purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it ,
's say that and then we can have our special coloured case
design could be done with um with uh plastic for some reason incurs no cost ,
plastic and some kind of solid design , we could save point accounted for about half of our expenditure
stems from the use of the L_C_D_ . I think if we remove the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point we 've removed a large part of how we were gon na interface ,
purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs
