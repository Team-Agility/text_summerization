channel selection , some people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds ,
design according to these buttons .
sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user friendly and fashionable way .
basic functions of the remote that would receive the location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ , battery for the energy source ,
remote should be used only for television , teletext is apparently outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that 's off the list . Um ,
radio signal like on a on a cell phone 's under the couch , so it would be a two line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it 's not gon na go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?
'Cause that that is something we have to decide , I mean it 's gon na be D_V_D_ type , that 's the the technology these days .
're on T_V_ , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button and number .
, so think about the things we 've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting .
's gon na go finish their questionnaire ,
back after lunch we 'll have thirty minutes of individual work , so think about the things we 've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting .
, so it would be a two part package .
budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .
target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range ,
build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall
call it then it 's
phone 's under the couch , you might not see the light ,
power button and numbers .
joystick flat touch thing , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that ,
cable might be a little loose or something .
project requirements , I 'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things .
