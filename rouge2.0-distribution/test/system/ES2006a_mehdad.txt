practice using some of the tools that we 'll be using during the the course of the design project briefly , this is uh first meeting of this plan
intuitive that people are able to use this product .
's the difference between the functional design of the the remote control
stages of the design , um trend watching in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh Interface Designer in this project .
's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , what specific things could be um included in this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .
functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , the new generation ones , where they do n't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .
'll see you in half an hour .
's the user requirements specification ,
're looking at the working design ,
're looking at the technical functions design ,
'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace ,
're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each .
're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros .
's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ .
button for a menu or something , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they do n't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .
users will just have a lot of problems
wrap it up now ,
