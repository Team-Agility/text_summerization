reasons that I do n't wan na turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you 've just found out from the board on how we 're not doing D_V_D_ , case you guys forget the slogan it 's , we put fashion in electronics .
grade recycled plastic as opposed to metal , something along those lines ,
n't use most of the functions remote presentation . Another remote control
younger demographic 's use , will really come into play with a lot of these people they 're
turn on a remote control , the voice recognition , a touch screen .
'm gon na save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders .
've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic built or uh b plastic cased
'm seeing that we 're gon na just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them ,
confirmed that we 're gon na go ahead with a uh touch screen for the basic functions .
wee this wee thing you know that 's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button and the voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple command like locate . Just a beep .
'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it 's
ta wonder though , we 're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gon na be able to meet that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development
