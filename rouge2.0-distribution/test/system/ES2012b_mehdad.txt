'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting of this uh keys group might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour . Um .
device has to incorporate the company logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , however , I will go through some new project requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet .
functionality , seventy five percent of people find the remote control .
's a function voice recognition , we do n't have was what proportion of people
button on the television product it 's a user centred , fewer buttons .
circuit chip is the part of the remote control is some sort of energy source , uh some sort of user interface
battery , reduce the uh , you know , the number of things you buy .
incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that 's no reason why we ca n't see why we should n't go for voice recognition
requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet .
cover televisions .
device has to incorporate the company logo and colours .
simple to get it to the market quickly ,
're looking at a radically different shape ,
minimum number of buttons um in into the design , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum ,
problem I can think of with that is if you 've got a lot of people that do n't see why we should n't go for voice from the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you 're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change it up and it 's use .
cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . That sounds pretty good , do n't they have sort of a combination of the two ,
's no reason why we ca n't introduce um interchangeable uh covers .
