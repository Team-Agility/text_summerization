ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want , marketing ,
'll just be I guess presenting information statistics on what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view .
remote control needs to be original , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money ,
work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer
main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board , badger .
mind here that the uh we want to sell a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet
people that want device , strong feelings about remote control
'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail .
mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um ,
profit for the the company of fifty million Euros
cost twelve Euros fifty to make .
