buttons as possible , you can flip it over , and there 's some there ,
scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down .

, if we 're happy with the design there 's no point in spending money , if we do n't have to .
room for creativity , everyone got enough input , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that .
