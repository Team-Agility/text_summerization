ideas from other people , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it 's sending the signal to .
powered by some form of I_R_ data that you 're saying the triple A_ battery ,
remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever , rather than having a lot of complex button tend to be a bit hard

Mobile phone batteries , something like that should reduce the size of it .

's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , if it was a C_ or something like that , you can still I mean think of the design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back .

, if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something ,
concept of a rechargeable something on the remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .
Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it 'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition
