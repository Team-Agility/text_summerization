remote control was you all the time
remote control
easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone
finally it has to be useful as a remote control of that and if we can provide you guys think it's a good sell
profit remote control with a lot of buttons
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
general people change tv more often than batteries on their remote control
market of remote control they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention
speech recognition technology we take at least five euros or that you put some control we want to reduce
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
device on that can be used for speech recognition or a beer cans with speech recognition
back and not to look at a new remote controls it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole
button and you can use your time on to it will take it some days to loan all these buttons
people dollars for which the remote control is Is to be something useful that i'm going to talk
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and battery and also we want to go for titanium design we should of rub
men were was some there you go to put a speech again The room
advanced chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive compared to lcd
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology inside
location and these people are really interesting on those features or they really like They're more want these fancy features
back light kills a lcd screen was different colours
rubber aspect might be important
recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology
Generally add developed quite a broad concept of the interface we used and if there is some supplements
flat different colours Depending on what is around like what colours around and depending on the temperature
simple to program where the chip do we have only the plastic or that cd five or A chip
important because it's what is pretty more feasible in terms of sponginess
follow smart should be some not too complicated
lighting we have many options in the market
problem is that this design we phone that we can't use the double record shapes
ready pretty to pay
sixty then you make a lot of money are you don't and you're out of business
colours they can be more money too bad These And the shapes and then they can have different assembly
cc says if we want to have a small number of button is power on and off on a team
Strangely enough it's more important thing it has to be fancy have to have a fancy look-and-feel and then interestingly
propose but the use of solar cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy would solar cells hand
friends you can travel from golf to furniture so it might be fruit and vegetable and spongy
selling point maybe it has to be the base
ready in the post and down to locate then we have to go for some speaker
blue You use maybe for the addendum Nobody's expense
story that for the point before why not the rubber i some rubber parts
plastic we stick last time
big and there's so i'm just asking them the current trends according to them when the going to store is that when they asked there are friends
decision we want to take on this meeting are on the them first and component concept so what energy and the media and the interface for energy
fruit these teams can be easily incorporate
interface there to use pushbuttons or you could just read it cd display would only be displayed and not a touch sensitive
phone we can use the phone as a good to Example of work to it beeps back
trend i hope i'm going to try to help you want that this is more risky
meeting in thirty minutes
record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that Mark the user interface design
end we find out that it's not feasible
straight on these individual action g which are for them ram out a bit design
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
red goes faster than the life
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
work together a menu on a prototype using modelling clay
body one call really come up with our forties
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning
puts lots of concentrate
