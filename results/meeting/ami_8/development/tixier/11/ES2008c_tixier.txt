lots of buttons for all the features
cost we should just go for push buttons which is what real reaction
hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
buttons could be shaped like different fruits
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional button
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
matter how many buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting
people to be able to use it as a remote control
summary that was market investigation on remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
button to switch off in case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery
simply it's cheaper to make pushbuttons and it is a scroll thing would be too fast
buttons to select your favourite channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the television send information back to the remote control
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
interface and we'll come back to the chip
circuit board and chip we can have a simple one a regular or advanced one depending
lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main ones being like and lemons or stripe
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
tend to watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv and the button to switch
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
model is a going to be for user interaction with this device
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
money into the like the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
essentially we need to choose how is this device this is an ipod from apple
fashion in our case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
type of battery you find in porches from about fifty years ago flashlights
number of different choices for a design concept and start
switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
essential properties of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface the tape and the supplements
examine each element separately but we're designing
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
find a way to protect on the inside
ideas had it possibly use these and how to use a fruit and vegetables have to haul
minutes from the functional design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
considerable notes on the matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these question on the weight of these different elements
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options that we have for manufacturing
attend a certain amount of space
presentation i have one more slide before we close but in that side
saved it this in the shared project
