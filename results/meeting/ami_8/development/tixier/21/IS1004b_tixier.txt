present this presentation that is what we want the remote control
research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
people want to be l to find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech recognition
perfect remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
time corporate to do with the remote control you start and then you stop
focusing on tv remote control or is this something for a reminder of televisions
feed the targets in front of cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
control to say to turn the volume up because i can't hear very i don't really want you'd run out what people are saying by talking one on one instead of pressing up on the remote control unit
pretty wide range of remote control shouldn't be very they have looked pretty hard
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
possibility is to download programme information into the lcd screen
young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
simplest thing the remote to change the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad
point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
limiting the number of button to enter to do and then the summer
list people are what it about the shape of the remote control
buttons it increases the difficulty of find it with missus and they improvements we could do to the car and remote controls
top of the could be a speech recognition technology switch at existing
industrial designer should work was supposed to work on the components concepts
showing now how easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
red so if you go to the market and you say that buttons which are not betty
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen just for changing channel
keen on going to speech recognition to adjust and that can fit
produce the tv you can have a lot of these background noise from a tv
simple there's only a few buttons but what each of those buttons does something different in a different context
speech recognition system as a wide and really quite a microphone also to be sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find
cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
programmes on off and you what channel already what's on If you have a list
working design is so user interface could be off more than one type
requirements i'd give it a marketing report is to tv remote court
problem means then the user has to understand each of that functionality
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared to also use going to implement
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press a button
option since this is pressed to be kinda fashionable device is there's a certain factor that you can you can have with technology
functional requirements and especially for the For the user requirements like a big courting all those things are required and for wise
live in a little in each of the the main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
button interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
programme you could have a start time but on the On the chip
television where you can say change the lighting in the courts and that cords out of stand-by then for a device to the receiver
design should fit the hand shape and it should not be really small
internet connectivity would be to have this program driven interface rather than the channel number
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
mobile phones are you don't use you don't remember people's fun be you remember the name and you're fine and then so this would be pretty comfortable if you want to get this and on top
requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
people to use on line which a case of by speak buttons out of something which is really everybody's the red
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
scd e still on this get used to open to discussion next meeting you have the task you have to work
focus more on the internet aspects because you see the text is outdated
find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
opinion there My and all these mine though shouldn't be bit smaller
master a very easy is assigned they could be sold in inside the court
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting similarly there are different interfaces
selling the potential of the device in use a potentially you can then do a look like change the lights and i close the windows what about the heating
eds they're more like and they good idea is to it looks like a year
final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
