user wants to help control more than one device want to control more than one device from the same remote control
findings is uses would be really interested in a look at the doing to find of the remote control
fruit bat that in that aspect of a of the remote control to be the shape of a banana
user's gonna buy and need a corner remote you do need my income for a remote buying
buttons are in the shape of fruits these buttons i have to be at some point it has to a circuit board
functionality is just a couple scroll-wheels not button it's hard to get so many buttons on the banana
tv at the fancy thing that's true you can bring to we can bring to the remote control
speak lost control
hold like the way you the end of the banana and the the the we the basis
powerful are powered by a man though it's a button on the fruit
easier to do a banana and plastic
end of the banana you wanna of holders may you may be one of the whole like a gun know and you don't have to point
scroll button but push technology for channel selection volume control and they need exposing these are the three scroll
fits in the hand and you had a lot of so phase two The for the controls
design and you have to work on the user should it should be already p define
cost a lot just feel five watch
conversation with the coffee machine that that with producing is you can say good morning how would you like a coffee
concentrating on like a fruit or you want to some like fruit but a different fruit
people would find out what's it even if it wasn't a recharging station even if they didn't have to buy batteries
worth but it doesn't really add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech recognition the speech
genetically engineered for it is designed to be square so they'd attack start it in the boxes
bite the things that by nine that and the base a station for the telephone handset
scroll past television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations
suggested that we have some wheels to control the volume is it's it's very handy for it to have the instant feedback and response
sell this is a very if it's gonna be a banana as a pretty gimmicky Think that doesn't have that much functionality
plastic with some elasticity so that if you're of the remote control what's the sample sensor sample speaker
rising is a factor for us that so we'll go for the regular chip in some way or is it just the signal
pray you do it is a fairly simple design so you'd have to record into the device
decided not to go for speech recognition technology just because of some reasons and all honesty
issues so where we place this chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana
beep or people are more the devastating never find a fancy look and feel down in the technology gonna be know in innovation
spend but charge idea of a banana but without looking completely pointless For the in the fall from the interaction
feel so old now More more core aspect not more hard core that aspect rather than a devise ways to many phones times on many buttons
real recognise i he was but he was in a set not like a freight you train
completely to forget about the lcd has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out so it's the basic
cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production components
importance from leicester more important is that People or nineteen ninety five percent of young people are worse
house and now you don't want the traditional users so that they don't feel the and i needed list
recognise it can be like a match on on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back
Twenty five twelve point without worrying too much about how to develop
combination just to train it's not the law and channel four hundred channels you have to be a tool to recognise
card application i would presume that it's they wouldn't design of the hand a hundred
back to the minutes of the last meeting we should take a decision on that point
find more interesting more important needs a fancy look-and-feel instead of a instead of the car and The car and train which was for the functional look and feel
work to do was to go to move forward
break so you'd have to worry too much about the case been broken is the inside
city's would not be possible to implement it for the next prototype is but actually integrated
additional it will be might be having slightly better market
hold a cap sit
draw some sketch about so which would be the pro the final product and that were part
decided that we can and spend twenty five euros is that profit
ripple it's all the ideas we've had we had doing these presentations just to draw some sketch
top of that we can have solar cells
cells and the lighting conditions are good that can be useful it'd be pretty in a week
thin veneer of wood be done in and all those things but plastic you can have the book but the side not the materials we cannot that the book
shape if you'd and not be out the door probably you may as do it in a style as way that just looks a bit more twenty first century route and sixties and seventies
missing israeli fancy and fun and if you teach works we go for the range
set it that's a switch with the double curve would actually menu and you could like drawer something on on the whiteboard
microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big
net at economic and oranges
