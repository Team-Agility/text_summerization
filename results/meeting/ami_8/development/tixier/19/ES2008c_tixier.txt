lots of buttons for the features
economics it's probably better to push buttons would recharge the battery
box is where you press the centre button
buttons could be shaped like different fruits
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional button
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
screen menu then we can scroll down on the scrolling
matter how many buttons remain things but then i go back
people to be able to use it as a remote control
remote control get a certain amount of a light
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu
button to switch off in case you get bored
ipods and things right now have touch scroll buttons
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control
determine what the essential functions of the device
interface and we'll come back to the chip
decided on like a simple a regular chip
lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen
tend to watch tv in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons
intrigued by the idea of the scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
model is a going to be for user interface
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
money into the like the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display
member of that this is the device going to work
fashion in our case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
type of battery you find in porches from about fifty years ago flashlights
number of different choices for a design concept and start
switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
user face we're gonna have to decide the interface
examine each element separately but we're designing
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
find a way to protect the circuit board
shaped like a vegetable colours we could colour
minutes from the functional design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
list a topic of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
minute or if you the minutes left of the meeting
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
work together on a prototype using modelling clay
fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these question on the weight of these different elements
mind that these are the options that we have for manufacturing
attend a certain amount of space
presentation i have one more slide before we close but in that side
saved it this in the shared project
