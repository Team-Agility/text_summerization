present this presentation that is what we want the remote control
research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
people want to be l to find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech recognition
roles in addition to the t what should be a special
restrict the remote control to tv only because of time mutations
focusing on television remote control or is this something for a reminder of televisions
feed the targets in front of cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
control have been have remain the same for the last five ten years
pretty wide range of remote control shouldn't be very they have looked pretty hard
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
possibility is to download programme information into the lcd screen
young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
simplest thing the remote to change the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad
talk about price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
number of button to enter to do and then the summer
people are what it about the shape of the remote control
buttons it increases the difficulty of find out a solution
top of the could be a speech recognition technology does mean sitting on the remote
industrial designer should work was supposed to work on the components concepts
showing now how easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
red so if you go to the market and you say that buttons which are not betty
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition
produce the tv you can have a lot of these background noise from a tv
groups or you could even have some buttons like on the sides
speech recognition system as a wide and really quite a microphone also to be sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find
cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important
move to another does it because i twenty five dollars
programmes on off and you what channel already what's on If you have a list
work and user interface could be off more than one type
requirements i'd give it a marketing report is to tv remote court
problem means then the user has to understand each of that functionality
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared to also use going to implement
press a button to talk and the tvt v set
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology
functional requirements and especially for the For the user requirements like a big courting all those things are required and for wise
live in a little in each of the the main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
button interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
programme you could have a start time but on the On the chip
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
seoul extend past the hand shape and it should not be really small
internet connectivity would be to have this program driven interface rather than the channel number
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
pretty comfortable if you want to get this and on top
requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
people to use on line which a case of by speak
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
scd e still on this get used to open to discussion
focus more on the internet aspects because you see the text is outdated
find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
opinion there My and all these mine though shouldn't be bit smaller
master a very easy to handle to scroll not too big
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting similarly there are different interfaces
selling the potential of the device You'll do we have problems
eds they're more like and they good idea is to it looks like a year
final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
