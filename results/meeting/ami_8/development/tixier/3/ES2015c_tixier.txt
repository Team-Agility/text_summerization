back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control
flexible design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
simple would go with the push button
links into the different depends on what type of buttons we have an input
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
cost of buttons what functions will show
test will have to look at how the remote control should be easy
actual remote would be hard plastic and put it in rubber or plastic
meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design
remote control would be cheaper design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television that people have in the kitchen
audio because we how other televisions work
change the buttons so one same colour just to keep it to the simplest o'clock
interface design so those are the trendy and we still have the money
flat then i got like on a cell phone a mobile phone so called a flat
ousted a kinetic energy is transformed into a power to make a circuit
lots of considerations for the case which we pulled aside and rubber
complicated and the controls would be more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons
symbol of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume
advanced would have to go with a lcd c display
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
specific a wimp should see what the success of the first Face plates
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
silly if we do point to have anything else just have to not important
work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job
solar power not maybe not working this have to shake it a bit and revitalise
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
weapon for the simple the weight that was the advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house
difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
popular thing we came up out of your market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
rubber would just be that what's in contact with the human eye
meet so it's a medium or regular chip was supposed to simple
contrast to last in the feel the material is expected to be spongy
including the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip
circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at ed
titanium is not to be possible in know it just to be on top budget
brings it thing we need to be recharged and the bulk the size
fruits and vegetable things if that's going to work for us sound
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television set
simplified Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentation
cutting edge technology wise kinetic
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
dynamo which is the thing that was used to which is fifty years ago the ousted
grapes think that's number two years and then the students
diodes transistors resonators resistors and passes it could pass it is all need to be considered
reconvene in thirty minutes it back
strip it down to like really basic shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real swimming or a store
amount of time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
stick to tv based maybe tv in the dark
problem with international a appeal if we have audio
personal coach will be the best of the information We need to start making some more specific decisions
confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost report
impact if it's got to something as they wouldn't damage just it's not so easy
