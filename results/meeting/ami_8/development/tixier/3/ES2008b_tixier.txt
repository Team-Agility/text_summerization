hundred a new remote control is quite subjective experience
left to we've got it's an engineering based design for a remote control
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote control
talk about the technical functions design objectives
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
personally what i want from a remote control what we want to do it sends a message
focusing on the designers people specifically said that it's not remotes were ugly seventy
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote
working design they need to be figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and that might be older people
money to buy a new remote all they want like an upgrade
sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls
designing several different at the types of user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source
appeals to younger people maybe people who have problem with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicated
easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task a step
age so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition
pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
brings energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data to the chip
breaks i was given in terms of each was the voice recognition
mentioned things like voice recognition but at the price
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
wind One large accessible buttons for the essential
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find a way of striking a balance
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
hides all the complicated buttons
imagine just it is an electronic device that allows us to do certain effects on the television
question earlier on whether this is going to be to for television screen
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
target group that means that is very few we need to each group
economic we need to find a balance between features and price as you mentioned
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d data is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
finally it is more marketing our corporate image has to be recognisable
receiver and in my opinion infrared
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes left to define our functions
battery and that that the chip and convert that much data and presents a while without strips gathering
price limit of the twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
instruction manual it comes at the end that's and hot because of the combination
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple
minutes i emailed them to you and also putting on them in the shared folder
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
twenty five euro
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
short amount of time you'll be able to access more of the website
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
white or thereabouts draw
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
