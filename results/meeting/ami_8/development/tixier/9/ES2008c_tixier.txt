lots of buttons for the features
cost we should just go for push buttons would recharge the battery
hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
buttons could be shaped like different fruits
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional button
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
screen menu of your channel traces then you can scroll down on the scrolling
matter how many buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting
people to be able to use it as a remote control
decision on the remote control get a certain amount of a light
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu
button to switch off in case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
simply it's cheaper to make pushbuttons and it is a scroll button
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel flipping and then the other white
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
interface and we'll come back to the chip
decided on like a simple a regular chip to keep our costs
lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen then back up at your tv and people
tend to watch tv in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel
model is a going to be for user interface list of device
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
options of using the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display
essentially we need to choose how is this device going to work
curve of a case we could do a flat which flat case the curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
type of battery you find in porches from about fifty years ago flashlights
number of different choices for a design concept and start
switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
essential properties of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface
examine each element separately but we're designing
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
find a way to protect on the inside
shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours we could colour
minutes from the functional design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard plastic
point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
fashion and simplicity and easy to use is necessarily the right drinking personally
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
sat our target group of so what we want so these are stacked
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these question on the weight of these different elements
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
attend a certain amount of space
presentation i have one more slide before we close but in that side
saved it this in the shared project
