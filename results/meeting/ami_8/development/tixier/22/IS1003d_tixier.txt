lemon tv would be pineapple remote control it's a pineapple
pockets and being used in the kitchen say i've lost remote control is there a prototype
shape because it's not like be on the remote controls can put in your pocket so i'm not in your jacket
compare with traditional control how to control the scale
channel but if you really want you to do zapping you laundry you want to you kinda and it's just go through all the channel
remote maybe if you have five for pushbuttons so we can do this and i'll try to modify
integrated scroll-wheel with push a button this is one integrated
turn off to ten to twelve button to thinking in the tv
shape of the buttons and is mushrooms
comparably to use for these are countries have to put a button and i don't have to push button
Final buttons that are it's a room
Genetically modified much room i was there but I couldn't speak
meeting went to have sought a remote control that would cost more than twelve fifty twelve but so far Thirty
weak point because with the traditional key traditional controller use button to select the channel
easy to you can say fifty and fifty
starts call so we can paint is all that to select channel
design you're looking at the chips as a lot of sense and do very informative
key features of our pro prototype
special colours Pushbutton
treat it easy to change things to change the board to change the channel
decided to have something yellow it's our company colour yellow and red for the costs
shape the first is the cycle and the second be the shape
pushing is euro left
leading the but if you do not but if you go nuts all the brought in all the channel to the next line to make and that's the sunlight
remote from the you have the like lemon senator it is yellow and black
scroll wheel and we have the colours course to find scroll wheel
cost to find it very funny an amazing interesting to goes for the process
problems and we're going to twelve euros and a half
black then use a regular colour and we have the fashion in electronics
Single curve or a single curved we can come from the double curved control

Yellow or when you say technology could be small i know in the core
marketing team to make a lot of advertisements and sending these solar cells
manual when you stop it and all you need the channel
tvvs where you can change it's aspect so likes for the cell phones
base you need to have everything in the hand if you want to turn
accept And the certain conditions the prototype will have a look to final some financial
floors of luck one yes it's a might be easy to take me load you can be take them as you can being innovative
Single simple chip on print
electronics to from the sample sensor to regular chip
technologically innovate innovative
flow and make it now and after is that people can just sends the appearance
curious to david jordan
Suggesting maybe we can create a conference then of a computer
worry and so for an basic or advanced
enjoy you or a plane modelling
