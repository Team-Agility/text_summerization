hundred a new remote control is quite subjective experience
left to we've got it's an engineering based design for a remote control
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote control
talk about the technical functions design objectives
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
personally what i want from a remote control what we want to do it sends a message
focusing on the designers people specifically said that it's not remotes were ugly seventy
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote
function of the working design they need to be figure
lots of buttons and that might be older people
money to buy a new remote all they want like an upgrade
sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls
designing several different at the types of user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source
appeal to people maybe people who have problem with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume
sit at a drastic difference between those two remotes
easiest thing to do is gonna be work
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition
chip that he in this designing it's gonna be crucial
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
button on the tv you can press the middle ring
components that we find here are the energy or data to the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
breaks i was given in terms of each was the voice recognition
mentioned things like voice recognition but at the price
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
wind One large accessible buttons for the essential
includes an emphasis on making the infrared very functional
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
find out find a way of striking a balance
talk a little bit about functional requirements that just received
hides all the complicated buttons
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television
question earlier on whether this is going to be to for television
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
talk about our functions and our target group at the demographic
economic we need to find a balance between features
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
bring the data is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the people mention that was the biggest
marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying
receiver and in my opinion infrared
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
worry about four minutes left to define our functions
battery and that that the chip and convert that much data
price limit of the twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
instruction manual it comes at the end of the spectrum
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple
minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
twenty five euro
Switch the quality a quality of the chair
short amount of time you'll be able to access more of the website
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
white or thereabouts draw
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
