easy to change your remote control
design we can make a design for those only those buttons
unique feature of a remote control and let them buttons
main important button And there are lots of people
power buttons and use one time and the volume
ten percent the buttons
method of the remote control is just a function of remote
lots of people complain they kind can find your remote control
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
easier way of a round button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
people would bother walking to tv and press that button because they are lost the remote
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set starts to make a weights out and your remote controls
push a button to switch the channel switching
user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
multi function and remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
channel selection is the most important
list of Functions then they mikes
decided to implement seemingly easy design
easy to use we my coat rack
support teletext is out of date and the internet
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
people do not always want to use the voice
attract all the people younger than forty
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
connected to free things user interface
remotes are reports it we give back to the user
device has to do is to send messages to tv set
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board
connected to the sender which generates
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment
market is interested in some advanced techniques
convinced sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light
cell phone just one like in the device which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
fancy lights and all that fancy
personally we should infer use infrared
production cost rr in just a part of the equipment
expensive and they're hard to implement
watching a movie it would can see beep
goal was a boston move you would like to start
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger than they have forty which is important
save costs and things like that battery life to the batteries
draw the ten minutes left this meeting
important point is that we really should use energy friendly components
fully concentrate on developing a product that is really what the market
generates a few times within that a certain period of time
part is forty percent of the market
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
older you might want to constrain that portion market
Reports or to spend response
summary of all things are spoken and the different concept
products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
home station for base station next to see this a little antenna
minutes i make into the shared folder
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box accidentally
signal from where do you execute the this in south
case we have to metal contacts
