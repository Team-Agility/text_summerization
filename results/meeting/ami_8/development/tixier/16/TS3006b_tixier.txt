easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
list of what functions are are going to to be on the screen menu
normal function the basic functions you normally press
menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
basic function if you are going to use the advanced one but a lot of options
zapping which are a remote control you can press the menu button and then you are certainly into the the display
people use mobile phones and also have a screen is on top which function
menu button so that if you press on the menu in the lcd screen
design of the bus buttons for a for all the channels you can just push one button
press a button and the teacher a goes It it sends a signal to a chip which are translates
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional functionality
confirm a want to go one step back it's only two extra buttons
hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle of it says menu
reach a little bit for the power button and channel volume selection are teletext
remote like this if you put it on the top on the side
concentrate more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen
channels and left or right for the volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons
features the above forty people are not so interests and to not interested in the screen and the speech
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program the channels
department do we need just the functional display and for curses
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
serving of one hundred subjects in the usability lab using the remote control options so we need to menus
lower age groups a design it's it doesn't make a remote control on noticed in your room
optional maybe you can go left or right end up and down in a in one menu
tvs in standby people of sixteen are quite used to technology so they adapted
channel and then it just say is which number do you want to save
younger users are more acquainted with these machines so they can use more advanced functions
save this and you just press the number in a remote and then say a confirm and then it's a it's easier
harder to if you have already program it to swap
idea because then it becomes clear about the extra two buttons or active
time to learn how to use a new remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
match the operating behaviour of the users are not afraid of a lot of functions
functions and on the Seems was it the target that's a group of forty
prefer we use the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
wary of space left and then put a logo should be like on top
visuals of the bride this with that sliding bar and the boss and the like that for sound and then within sounds i trouble on base you need to change
screen like on a mobile phone are just are some stripes a little holes
television itself is also the options that brightness and screen settings mono stereo page
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
clear distinction between age groups concerning the features but we just have to build them in because they find
tvs automatically display the name which you get to the cable
threw it at transformer it's the signal gets a boost that and then sent to the tv and that if you will Translated into a function
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television it's difficult
plug in the power cable when you go back to it to upper level which twos and focus
consequences on the marketing a part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
overview of what we discussed in our last Meeting
news flash also stated that so it should control only one device only your television
product should reach a new market which is the customers below forty
spend a lot of time to integrate that information that i need so frustrating
problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway and lots of the times there is a brand present
skip this price as because i read a ball forty so we could skip the features
work for thirty minute ago
received an email so i'd like we'll use so i'd just drop it in the folder
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
kinda structure in two layers
figure or figure out a way to do that easily
overrides the previous and previous
called a cold lasts
mit v doesn't have any cue equalising
