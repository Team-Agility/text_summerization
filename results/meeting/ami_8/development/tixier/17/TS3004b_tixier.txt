coach and it should be a tv remote control especially when you only have tv function
find it and it when you just press a button and it doesn't work
remote controls with a lot of options
skip the lcd u on the remote control
reading on a page remote control just sends come on space six months to to television
time to learn how to use are the new remote control eight percent use would spend more money when a remote control would look look fancy
points we had last meeting was should be you universal remote control are often lost somewhere in the room
remote control becomes a green if you press a button to go to the next one or two ago could prove
room so we have to understand what button are used to to make it universal
special all the plo eight people might be bigger buttons
random people so they're all and not younger people what they use what they want on remote control
pressed or like you press the one that circuit chip knows what button to switch get close
teletext option Maybe we have to skip
light under the and the numbers anything do if you press
small light around the button you push so you see green
missed did i miss any other buttons to call
normal be put in the simple buttons on the top
channel above ten normally you can press
period of an five seconds to press the buttons and that know for elderly people to look one to press and a man
simple is to use to send the standards So standardise the methods like a know remote controls
point is if we made make remote control for only television it's hard to sell it for twenty five euros
divide between functions you often used like maybe switch channels and volume and that things and the menu button
automatic only search function for each television dvd players t real and vcr had a question
seventy five per cent of users find out what people use maybe just use questionnaires on the internet
hard to remember if i press that button it goes to that channel connects to what favourite
problem to because you have to be fast enough maybe the elderly people so we need to keep it simple
fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons
zap a lot and the watch over five hours tv control hanging that it stands
finally have a conclusion that younger people in or a nature for forty five for more interested in new features
younger people often use teletext is become outdated since the popularity of internet and elderly
stand out unique we have the design is most important you can do integrate that volume and previous
fits at the what time if you set about the older people want to spend more money
full like your it's already said only ten percent on the top ten year
fall open system so when you clap your hands it will beep
screen green or red
buy this one this is a normal ball so the normal light not led light
functions i could think of volume channels the basic a call that number but This one two three cetera the text there's options basic on off and find
work them and does it have to work only in english or in dutch
lights up everything light this invisible and this one's producing infra-red lights emitting diode
configuring the spectrum just chip is trying to switch off the television
text and always have to pick a number only numbers for the more nothing but only the numbers want to twenty
optional like we discussed like ipod different colours
recognition about you said one and the television turns
receptor in the tv senses that's room
fallen off to take the efforts to design something with the speech recognition you can just throw
connecting to it chip sends out that's our to the infrared bulb
idea that can be done by just could change changing the spectrum all the time to put it on the market
chip for is producing the pattern Like a morse code
required because it like in a mobile phone in the dark
product should reach a new market this custom and our do you wanna forty so it should be flashy
Red so it show that like something's
circuit as close to produce is the pattern
sixty five persons the city of persons of the users said they zap
moral on you you type search and to do that began
main thing is the usability that's when we can make it a special product or own style
colours you can choose blue or yellow
ohio services and the other side
live in the centre of the room that's exactly what we said about maybe a home station for for it to to recharge the batteries
orange Lunch break
battery's low all your homework
