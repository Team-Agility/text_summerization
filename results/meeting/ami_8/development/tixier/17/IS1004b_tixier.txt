present this presentation that is what we want the remote control
research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
people want to be l to find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech recognition
extra internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
time corporate to do with the remote control you start and then you stop
focusing on tv remote in that as a replacement remote control or is this something for a reminder of televisions
targeting the replacement remote as one bad and the person wants to buy a new remote
control to say to turn the volume up because i can't hear very i don't really want you'd run out what people are saying by talking one on one instead of pressing up on the remote control unit
pretty wide range of remote controls on ep means talk on which is a customer know written review side
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
possibility is to download programme information into the lcd screen
bring new technologies for young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
simplest thing the remote to change the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad
point because actually having all that some of the remotes out there this is quite although our price
limiting the number of button this is that operating our universal remote control or a meeting
prototypes for right and left handed people are what it about the shape of the remote control
buttons it increases the difficulty of find it with missus and they improvements we could do to the car and remote controls
top of the could be a speech recognition technology switch at existing so deeply the book would be which is the easiest
work it does work was supposed to work on and so on the working design issues
showing now how easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
red so if you go to the market and you say that buttons which are not betty
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen you just scroll for that program rubber band to a channel
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition gets in the way more than that helps
main formations on the tv you can have a lot of these background noise from a tv
simple there's only a few buttons but what each of those buttons does something different in a different context
speech recognition system as a wide and really quite a microphone also to be sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find
cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
programmes on off and you what channel already what's on If you have a list
working design is so user interface could be of two things one is the usual
idea but as a marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition
problem means then the user has to understand each of that functionality
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared to also use going to implement
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press a button to talk and the tvt v set
option since this is pressed to be kinda fashionable device is there's a certain factor that you can you can have with technology
functional requirements and especially for the For the user requirements like a big courting all those things are required and for wise
live in a little in each of the the main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons
programme you could have a start time for me to to bring you to some new way you informations
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be really small
internet connectivity would be to have this program driven interface rather than the channel number
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
mobile phones are you don't use you don't remember people's fun be you remember the name and you're fine and then so this would be pretty comfortable if you want to get this and on top
teletext but we want to get read one of four requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
people to use on line which a case of by speak buttons out of something which is really everybody's the red
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
scd e still on this get used to open to discussion next meeting you have the task you have to work
bring testing sings i have seen them on the one that's got a welcome pick it or is this we'll that we can use to navigate
find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
opinion there My and all these mine though shouldn't be bit smaller
master a very easy is assigned they could be sold in inside the court
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
forces you had a company which is putting the fashion in electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting similarly there are different interfaces
selling the potential of the device in use a potentially you can then do a look like change the lights and i close the windows what about the heating
mount the for the naming we see fault for the look-and-feel later so let's go for this representation
final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
