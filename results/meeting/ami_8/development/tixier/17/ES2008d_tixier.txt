menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing
press you testified button at the chip very visible very big
middle button it brings up down screen menu function of the power button
buttons you for breast slept three times in the menu button right here in the middle
repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push
buttons will be in special colour But that's important
shapes and then discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons work together as a team the digital
corpora wanna know we could also have alternative colours not are not text but this is the general
stay here all the time we had a lot of information and they're the same time
changing channel selector s and we have our little menu
ipod you just every seconds you wanna go back in the menu button again it brings
answer every single curved case how many colours what the colours that's curved
case you can't send an infrared think a signal to that to find even know this is like your initial i'm initially
pictures of the different parts of the case that if it looks of the case out of college
tend to meetings and then people say they have frustration what was in the remote and that they didn't provide
pretty hard to mess
break down the on the agenda was like several point down at the point of the meetings
mine it was like would you prefer an lcd screen or multi-function remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria
creating from the excel file that was a mike that option to select to some other included
tera that's a pretty high learning curve it'll be easy
designs to be used even in your left hand or on your right hand around this time
felt the first two meanings i was coming in with no information we got a menus
buttons are used the scrolling up and down for a list of justice you find the choice
confusing but if we had all the buttons in black and a design and the outside and yellow that we're corpora
detailed design meeting in pretty excited
chosen not to do a powerpoint saying that they made sense if we had a larger group
fashionable can you make a remote it's pretty in technology in fashion and so those are the mexicans
talk about here it is it just evaluating how we create this project evaluated those kind a questionnaire
opinion but if we're now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle
difficult to just have an external device like labels on the buttons all the product
chairs are like they have the option to do that and just take my own notes
lose i do think that on a scale of one to seven and how easy or hard to press
order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit and chip and trends partners and i wrote
ri and same scale for functionality is a functional
decisive person's the top to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes
stand up like this on your table if you want it to if i made about the bottom flat
sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons including five research of them and threatened that shortly we could've taken that into account
excel at a my favourite programs
war have the prototype you did you work together or did you like to separate projects
decisions what we need to do is first of all decide on the shape he came up with the potato we mango we shape
Project process That section with the room for creativity leadership teamwork means any new idea screen we don't have a teacher
finally it to production evaluation using the criteria look at the finances
could've used another five or ten minute And and this in the meeting what we just discussed the war
people should really base they're both sort fruit and vegetables in really good like creativity
link i what the side i would just get slide subtitles
energy we're gonna use the kinetic battery that's expensive but we have a sample chip
hold it you they're like this in your left it or you switch
worried at the end of the last meeting that we were getting we didn't have enough an information to make firm decisions
big market evaluation even just have it one set of source in a word
net i know you're saying you're a little bit nervous about that i it's a remind
distinctive that it's not just like another be the technology around your house
page they didn't give me any clue year like yellow grey but on the slogan's and blue
minutes so that it will include all the agenda and all that fifteen
excel sheet they were actually gonna calculate the costs under twelve fifty euro it's on to the project
address the fact that it does need to have a corporate logo so let's make we keep that in mind your more knowledge management
crazy like a lecture mac but you push it was sent to the tv and stick
pen was a little distracting for me personally
small but still like queue but dean
lightning bolt or not very cute
