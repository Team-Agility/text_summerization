double curved then you can that's you can only use the rubber buttons you can as you scroll wheels
possibility for us to use scroll bar the scroll wheel
personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control
watching a movie and you haven't move the remote a remote control
scroll wheels that's the speaker the speech recognition the rubber The fancy colours
scroll is work with one one curved single curved
note if you want to use these rubber of the case
volume button and either on the side but do you touch
customers specifically ask for the spongy feel you need to to make it buttons all of rubber
scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons
colouring is important and soft materials
implemented with the regular chip we can still control advanced functions the chip
high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
market would like something titanium casing
Integrating a scroll bar on this side
fruit you have to colours We have to simple design
fronts On which the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
email is immediately start with the individual presentations the programmes
voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
older group a step further dark colours simple shapes from the material
light blue and it's also a yellow
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular
forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic
buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch
fruit and vegetables are important for clothing shoes and furniture
previews i deserve voice recognition and the round buttons for the channel programming and volume
feel of the material has to be spongy
suggest we use the sensor so if you say mute
Point i would like to some issues that would like to point
cost rating on the young group like from a material
yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours
cell phones which exchangeable cover with the rubber finishing
latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cell solution for the energy
move that's the sense of it and you can store
tv when you have to make some energy kinetic energy
cd displays there's no way you can integrate scroll wheels
curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
Ease of use it is important but innovation is more important
issue i addressed at the beginning of the meeting the voice function we with the infrared issue
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar
talk about all the different components wire in this design of the look and feel The user interface design
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
space in our finance i would say do integrate some functions
lcs ids at this is what this is my personal preference but i bet i understood that the market
version of the advanced a version of the chip supports lcd that's all and we've decided
piece of this action to it's that's really the mute
imagine it's very goal to talk to a device with you have two points to another device
devices like at telephones and are radio pocket radios
personal coach will give you more information
watch in a display or which channel you have chosen like that often the amount of volume
watch you watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of energy then the shaking
walls the reef like the infrared light
bright anything down could you put it on the shared folder
carpets on the wall which are natural of mean friends
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion
afraid is not possible to print a picture or the size
