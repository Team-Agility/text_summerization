important still what so what functions there are we want to put in the remote control
simple word that they won't use the remote control with only basic tv functions
dozen of dozens of remote control or we could like make up a button
import because we gonna make such a basic Remote control we have to do something to make it special a nonissue
control we can implement features that of functions that to control other devices
fifty percent says they only use ten percent of the buttons on the remote control
trendy look all the all seven percent of the market is consists of elderly people at who don't really care for trendy look so whatever i it can do no harm to make a trendy the trends in the markets
open it may be contains some future date you don't normally linked to the remote control i have most of the hour
company already cells remote control to older people are How do you say watched using remote controls and usability lab
talk about the elderly you are willing to spend money on a remote control
remote control in a lot of television otherwise the project becomes more complex which endangers time lot of time to market
jump on the couch you pick up the remote and the universe want if you want to keep it simple
difficult is not a very common function and people are more able to adapt to new technology in their form
deliver that it would be the record should functions know basic functions it's very important to find
part of remote control the technical aspects which it won't work so out already but it shouldn't be a problem
settings about how do you settings video settings and channel settings are not set to be very important
minus button should be quite present
easy market we have to do something special features on it to make it transparent
simple design and no other functions and just if you but taste do aim at the younger format
discuss and What features for a higher usability lab and they also fill out a questionnaire with a few questions
functions shane it's one when we get a user requirements of the new pretty i was told
start with that technical functions
current customers that are younger than forty maybe that's not very no we don't really need to have a simple remote control
easy to make it also are rechargeable that i don't think that's gonna much to make it also recharge
stiff specifically name all the function and an extra previous channel
additional requirements for work
televisions there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with a new functions
lights also around the volume should we do we make them very big button
show you some of the new project requirements that were sent to me I'm gonna make a decision
electrical circuit Which compose messages in the form of infrared signals to control the television
lost how do you press the button are used four hundred and sixty eight times per hour
time goes by and i never put them in a recharger of thing last one often that put it on site
implement vcr and dvd options group them in the button
people wanna buy it they have to think about is more or less for a long time supposed to single cost
buttons should make it possible to zap through the channel a rabbit ever pays
leave ninety percent off but It says we should make it to complicated Fifty
talk about the working design of the shape or some gauge it's future work
technology like the circuit board it's the most important Part of the remote control
opening we've got three presentations and i'm gonna show
remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group but isn't that for more person you our corporate
ellen but they from my experience is kind a lot of dvd player like for reading
trendy design and we have seventy five percent of the market is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years
fun age range of ten to twelve
action to be honest it's a very small market you're talking about we already covered at our company
spend base unit underneath it is also round brown's
compromise we could make is just to make one teletext browsing
day i've never seen that before you make it and they use you'd with the mother the mouses nowadays can last two years three years with two batteries
individual round was half an hour
remote control for television you don't need to be able to program the vcr to start recording at three pm or whatever just play stop
user it saps all rsi court of hear from the results I said buttons
bow a couple weeks ago i looked at for the slides and there are a lot of slides in one page
blinking light we know the ones that also blink when it tries to a locator remote
program should be there i because your hand so you are ends will be in the small a part
focus on the one hand the experts if you all or none of issues
lots of newer televisions can store pages and you can just get menu
relevant because we're are aiming at a young
received from the account manager send me there are contradicting
fibreglass with copper wires
swap a ball front
balancing pets which you can just throw
