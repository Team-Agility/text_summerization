implemented with the regular chip we can still control advanced functions the chip
extra high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
market would like something titanium casing
Integrating a scroll bar on this side
stick with the simple as straightforward and not curve design and it's too dull
discussion the digits six on the bus and it will disappear when it's from rubber
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved or flat case that's the most common remote can control form
voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
older group a step further dark colours simple shapes from the material
light blue and it's also a yellow
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular
