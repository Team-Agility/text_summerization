easy to like at the different shape and up in a in this button
big banana shaped remote control and casings of different shapes different fruit
technology that it was meant in the remote control that other than just putting it as it is as the other or a remote control
bare essentials that we need to have a remote control there is some inconsistency
remote control market so there but we also considered the greatest threat fashion trends of the market
people want like if somebody wanted in banana shaped we will put that case we want to that war waveform
identified as a fruit shape so in such a way that any giving can you could be fit
survey findings was that they want to easy to use a i'm not about the lcd
engineered so we ended up make it different difficult shape they will just make it mixed and matched type shape
buttons do we want to just have a device that maybe sets and pretend it's a fruit
marketing to thirty five to thirty five so most people are we doing to be able to but they want the choir
signals from the buttons in translates into the sequence of courses that it then sends the amplifier
idea to you then i will these table so she was then people use mile mice mouse is now with the scrolling
designed to share then we can have a public some of the led to probably choose
people have a later date clothes shoes and furniture everything that fruit and veggie day was causing
sit on a say in that and It's quite got a quite a steady pace
trend is going to affect a remarkable attention and how important the second factor
opposite what does it make the on the upper side or side with the microphones so you can place it face time
pictures of some a new remote controls to show you that press escape
interface the buttons and you point to it rather than having the output is a stream of text
specifically as voice activated
speech thing it doesn't have to be hand held a closed you can set
everybody's got a fruit and veg a day was to be process is that what they were data
functional look and feel good you should have a fancy look and for the feel of the material
pointing out that this one the volume it is pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape
easy because there will be on lcd c display in the room a different friend
meeting in half an hour glass half of what we need not to have a full colour we will just have a half of colour
comfortable to hold easy to hold off on the side you can have a banana look all apple
today to be they have got they are going crazy with the lcd technology this as a man we small and cheap
standard off the shelf a chip
important aspect in the data to take into consideration is that it should be easy to talk
oval double curved send it to me if we're talking about three or can we can easy
specific functions all that in a play stop it got a minute
options from wood or titanium rubber plastic casing and then the buttons and property two different colours
rechargeable battery will be a good idea but then they have to keep them and they are more whites outside the solar energy
colours so and all in yellow tend to go to together crs main body
lay that it's got like a little scroll function on the side but i presume
work on giving me a model in clay
scroll it and then when you reach the a menu item that you require you pressed the middle of a scroll

casing this email i got from our manufacturing team
doubles as a standard parts and for using it as a recharging of also for using it as send recognition
features we had the fancy chips we need to buy input and which add to the cost as we can expect
discussion over less anybody's got questions The confusions i'm confused
open up there's a circuit board inside it just powers
lead to do it in to find out that and was into the lower
secure areas and i've seen a lot of them with the cover missing so like other hand like what it is portable phones
sends out the infrared light signal to the television writers
Mail to use the minutes of the last meeting i'm going to discuss what the trend watching
program it like you say you record and then play vd player and it we're handling
preference is just a imagination the race symbols everything but it's pointing
twenty five thirty five euros a cat or twelve years fifteen manufacturing
rl the data but it is good for have ten which is quite this for the one that we can begin
price and price not withstanding is it too complicated it's it can be too much just overloaded
tk it's and it's quite an organic a chef and the little circle and that's pretty
automatically if you put in project documents as you want project document
promote any size we like or is there a minimum
