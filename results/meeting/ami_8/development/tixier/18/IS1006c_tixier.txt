remote control was you all the time
remote control and speech recognition
easy to use as a remote control
finally it has to be useful as a remote control
profit remote control with a lot of buttons
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
general people change tv more often than batteries on their remote control
market of remote control they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention
simple button and speech recognition technology we take at least five euros or that you put some control we want to reduce
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
device on that can be used for speech recognition
back and not to look at a new remote controls it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole
button i the weirdest maybe one of these buttons
people the young people want to be different from their friends
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and battery
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser
chip technology and it's more expensive compared to lcd
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology inside
location and these people are really interesting on those features
back light kills a lcd screen was different colours
rubber aspect might be important
recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology
concept of the interface we used and if there is some supplements
paints that can colours around and depending on the temperature
chip do we have only the plastic or that cd five or A chip
week about the last year now it has to be spongy
stick with two batteries solar smart
lighting we have many options in the market
problem is that this design we phone that we can't use the double record shapes
ready pretty to pay
sixty then you make a lot of money
shape it has to be more wrong than the More roo look natural
cc says if we want to have a small number of button we need to have a i'll put that says creaky what they are actions
important thing it has to be fancy
propose but the use of solar cells
criterion the trends that we seen big cities like paris and milan it seems that this year think it should have a fruit and vegetable
selling point maybe it has to be the base
recogniser but we want to goals speaker independent or speaker
blue You use maybe for the addendum Nobody's expense
tomatoes and It's that easy they're rubber is expensive
plastic we stick last time
talk about with their friends mine has this and that euros And finally
component to use for energy and the media and the interface for energy
fruit these teams can be easily incorporate
reduce the cost on the display
phone we can use the phone as a good to Example of work to it beeps back
trend i hope i'm going to try to help you want that this is more risky
meeting in thirty minutes
record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that Mark and then sandy
end we find out that it's not feasible
action g which are for them ram out a bit design
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
red goes faster than the life
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
source of information is the weather
body one call really come up with our forties
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning
puts lots of concentrate
