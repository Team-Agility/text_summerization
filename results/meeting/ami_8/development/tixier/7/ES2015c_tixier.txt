slightly i know i've had a remote control
flexible design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
simple would go with the push button
links into the different depends on what type of buttons
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
cost of buttons what functions will show
live up to our purpose of having a very fashionable remote control
plastic and put it in rubber or plastic
agenda for this so this particular meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design
plug designs on to this type of rubber
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television
audio because we how other televisions work
colour just to keep it to the simplest o'clock
user interface design so those are the trendy
phone a mobile phone so called a flat
kinetic energy is transformed into a power to make a circuit
case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat
complicated and the controls would be more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons
symbol of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume
advanced would have to go with a lcd c display
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
wimp should see what the success of the first Face plates
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
Screen settings was use zero point five times an hour
work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job
working this have to shake it a bit and revitalise
meeting will be forty minutes will be meeting
weapon for the simple the weight that was the advanced chip
rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
popular thing we came up out of your market
rubber would just be that what's in contact with the human eye
separate apart from the chip was supposed to simple
contrast to last in the feel the material is expected to be spongy
including the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip
circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at ed
titanium is not to be possible in know it just to be on top budget
brings it thing we need to be recharged and the bulk the size
happy to go ahead with the fruit and vegetables
individual components so we'd have to get it in separately
Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentation
cutting edge technology wise kinetic
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
looked at the design reports from previous years ago the ousted
grapes think that's number two years and then the students
diodes transistors resonators resistors and passes it could pass it is all need to be considered
reconvene in thirty minutes it back
strip it down to like really basic shape
amount of time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
stick to tv based maybe tv in the dark
problem with international a appeal if we have audio
information We need to start making some more specific decisions
confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost report
impact if it's got to something as they wouldn't damage just it's not so easy
