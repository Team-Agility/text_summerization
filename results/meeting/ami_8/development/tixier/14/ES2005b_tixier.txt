remote control we design have ago better a better broke read their designs then we can hope that consumers and that for this the remote controls
cost of all of remote control last time Where do we add
functions of the users in their remote controls we should emphasise but actually can do more hard for the operate better than making it too complicated
built since the tv there which might make a remote control of the obsolete
eighty percent of the country where they find too difficult to operate a remote control
find it that was more like in a few watching a fill in the dark you can still see the remote control
build spacecraft you'll have no problem of the remote control
problems of the balloon was are facing the existing remote control so available in the market Seventy five percent
feature which which is brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature or noise
speak something of the remote control it applies to something and it glows in the dark about this sectors
market ancient art of how we should design can do other remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros
user interface for this to be just a bunch of buttons
people most of teams and people they find that the remote control
consumers they're willing to have pay more for speech recognition in terms of the interference and not working
remote for to change the channel or to turn the tv
eyes was that the This is for a specific television
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television
appears that the user interface to it you only need to find
number buttons functions
kinda feels a bit different from a lot of remote controls the rubber
safety point it's if we look at the market those people
miss out on the buttons organic design and how it fixed
exist it's not very widely use i don't think easy find a with a whistle functional
mentioned that the current products don't always match users operating behaviour
work for a while though because of this noise problem they mentioned
press the pick want to get on to the big
telephone that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons
methodology a doctor to find out of this it was market a detailed
mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people like glow in the dark
told us that Consumers are willing to spend more for fancy product
users of data more a tv and then also made it pick up the noise and turn
work with all these product i have a great deal of experience with the industrial designer
complicated design should be appropriate should be good looking for the consumers
limit the number of button and if you hit that menu the top
low tech and not too many buttons set appeal on to consideration
noise over certain threshold on a topic up as a distress signal on from you and i'll be back
listed options we hand that they require of that it's very hard
bells and whistle we gotta come up with a gimmick but not too complicated
electronics so we as the company we want to make a product trendy in fashion a big concern
standard interfaces the people use already windows style dropdown menus
cheaper than tft it's just a microphone and some integrated circuits
material is Maybe not this a tail maybe more like this work for a materials
twenty five to thirty five is the usual
pretty in the house or say that in this a day in this part or age group from fifteen to thirty
major factor to load take into consideration when i was a profit
colours and fashion were important so maybe just like little line this around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour
realistically then we need a product that's got some kind an ft outer casing cheap
encoding i'm getting from little bits of what channel and then you so like a bbc one and it goes to that channel
integrating the rabbit integrate the logo on as bright yellow
shout your command to it do it for you if it's within what i'm hearing range
decided in the last meeting that i have to find
definite requirements that they will that we need to scroll
organic shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corner
Fifty million dollars a rough
cut the classes once i hit
opposed to with batteries we don't need to provide all we pride fast batteries but it's more it's that's cheaper to justify battery
include teletext because it's become outdated everybody uses the internet
update but it anyway so your hand held portable
