easier to integrate several functions in one button to confirm
list of what functions are are going to to be on the screen
normal function the basic functions you normally press
menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
Channel up and down and the control of the advanced one but a lot of options and functions and buttons is easy
zapping which are a remote control you can press the menu button and then you are certainly into the the display
people use mobile phones and also have a screen on top
button so that if you press on the menu in the lcd screen
design of the bus buttons for a for all the channels you can just push them and like that so the physical aspect
press a button and the teacher a goes It it sends a signal to a chip which are translates
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional functionality
confirm a want to go one step back it's only two extra buttons
problem with the button in the middle of it says menu
reach a little bit for the power button and channel
remote like this if you put it on the top of sweet
concentrate more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen
navigate the channels and left or right for the volume
features the above forty people are not so interests and to not interested in the screen and the speech recognition
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program the channels
functions your hand will block the display and for curses
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
layout of the remote control options so we need to menus
remote and that you can choose what the design it's it doesn't make a remote control on noticed in your room
optional maybe you can go left or right end up and down in a in one menu
elderly people of sixteen are quite used to technology so they adapted
week or on the channel number do you want to save
younger users are more acquainted with these machines so they can use more advanced functions
select a number in a remote and which want to save
harder to if you have already program it to swap
clear what you have to buy a pack your first page
time to learn how to use a new remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
match the operating behaviour of the users are not afraid of a lot of functions
update for the audience or the target that's a group of forty
basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
wary of space left and then put a logo should be like on top
sound and then within sounds i trouble on base you need to change
microphone it can be very small if you look at your mobile
television itself is also the options that brightness and screen colour
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
features but we just have to build them in because they find
tvs automatically display the name which you get to the cable
threw it at transformer it's the signal gets a boost that and then sent to the tv and that if you will Translated into a function
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television it's difficult
plug in the power cable when you go back to it to upper level which twos and focus
consequences on the marketing a part you don't have to design
overview of what we discussed in our last Meeting
news flash and teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
product should reach a new market which is the customers below forty
spend a lot of time to integrate that information that i need so frustrating
problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway and lots of the times there is a brand present
sixteen to twenty five to thirty five to forty years of thirty
