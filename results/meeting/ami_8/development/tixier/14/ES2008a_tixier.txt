remote control it should actually work
assume that it's just a television that we want to control
major buttons for that work for everything volume control
buttons and you have to pass to actually turn on the tv
remote that has the main function of the on off channel changing volume and at the right remote with all the special
creating a new remote control which we have three goals about it needs to be original
industrial design only now we doing on the working design
silly on them that normal remote
complex over Did combining all the remotes can together versus having if by different remotes
remotes around my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes
individual work and a meeting
remotes together and then on off a necessarily like that if like to end
watching tv i have a we separate remote controls of in front of me and one for the tv one for the digital box one for the video recorder
stick to having television on the top it simpler to show us buttons
generate a little bit of discussion about the project it could have like to you by your experiences using rubber remote controls
save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would need to use every day
tv on that note that happen on the remote a number of a beep or a corporate so now in terms of how we're gonna make it but if it's like all the tv set
tv that you have to do one for the power the tv
training so we're gonna work that whiteboard
working on this one for about twenty so we continue
user interface designer that's real that's Technical functions i like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons on the user requirements
programmed into it's all just in a separate place and not like all the on button see a doctor
discussing and the next meeting the banana
simple are just to just run on the tv
continue discussing more new ideas
define this up in the three compact three parts first the functional design
normal the to the project plan to little discussion
play in the court and stop buttons on the tvd recorder
hoping that we can all work together to achieve
street moving it around to get it to work with the infrared
special functions occasionally
define what or aiming for if it's just a television
leave and technically be possible to include video recorder functions
rose and then i'll be the project manager From california
sounds like we've had a good little session for our first ideas mind
supply and i really wanna do is change the channel
residence right now the television you should have to walk all around the room together to turn on so it's just simple
breakdown of what will be doing individually the industrial
necessarily it's i have a solution favourite animal i have no draw skills whatsoever
tech rid of animals they can split
beautiful animal person
discussion that we've been having we'll get from the actual concern is consumers
meeting starts in thirty minutes and probably numbers
weekly phone phillies whatever have a good time
user requirements so do we hearing about different runs how about different things that people
powerpoint presentation for us for the kick-off meeting
draw a little Turtle for you all Not necessarily
bob of into a quaint and so just going to know each other little bit including a tool
opening and then i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project bob of into a quaint
older people or people like me that are fake court needed hand i it's really quite important that you're not pressing a small teeny mobile phones size buttons
television at the with the market range of the internet like it's in international market range we do have to worry about specifics
order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro So we're sell
specific instructions sent by your personal coach i realised in this past
end up to multimedia overload it just wanna watch
solve complicated supply
lazy like mean the print outs
evidence attended a bit confusing
original trendy and user-friendly
beginning harder wondered
glad you get a common really set
