slightly i know i've had a remote control before which you can tell which is the front and the back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons are you don't necessarily need to have it on remote
flexible design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
simple would go with the push button
links into the different depends on what type of buttons or just the push button
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons on and the shape was so some that's that are be pressing like a volume but instead of that one button
cost of buttons what functions will show
live up to our purpose of having a very fashionable remote should that the remote control concept and how we're gonna make a what it really is and that thing the meeting
actual remote would be hard plastic and put it in rubber can get on top
agenda for this so this particular meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design minutes to just black buttons
remote control would be cheaper design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
decided that the command line interface requires you to type text role commands that the user uses to control its operation and input data
incorporate some of the graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point device
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television agree i if we can make a remote that will be universal
audio because we how other televisions work
change the buttons so one same colour it's face could have its own colour of button
explain what the user interface design so those are the trendy and we still have the money
flat then i got like on a cell phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons that actually that control controls that are behind the rubber
lots of different possibilities for the energy you don't need an x then also the battery supply all solar energy source idea that's been used by some watches and that devices where you just shake in the device and it gives it to power to make a circuit
end so more internal casing and the rubber coating which is on the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat
complicated and the controls would be more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons
symbol of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power which we've been sitting inside a building
advanced would have to go with a lcd c display
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
wimp should see what the success of the first Face plates are busily to keep in mind
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
Screen settings was use zero point five elements on a scale of ten that's brightness
work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job
Pop in tarot will have to work off of them see how fashion to shake it a bit and revitalise
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
weapon for the simple the weight that was the advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house cat our dog
difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
popular thing we came up out of your market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
sie it's like at the same rubber would just be that what's in contact with the human eye
separate apart from the chip that we going to called so it's a medium or regular
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
including the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip
components of the circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at ed
titanium is not to be possible in know it just to be on top budget
brings it thing we need to be recharged and the bulk the size
recent fashion update to have a quite a fashion watchers in paris and milan is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual components so we'd have to get it in separately
Display anyway you that will probably won't have to focus so much not be more than the numbers
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint i can't remember what it's got at the components
cutting edge technology wise kinetic
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
dynamo which is the thing that was used to which is fifty years ago the ousted
keyboard so the numbers are like a keyboard you pressing
pushing the light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
reconvene in thirty minutes it back
strip it down to like really basic shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real swimming or a store
amount of time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user
stick to tv based maybe tv in the dark
problem with international a appeal if we have audio
personal coach will be the best of the information We need to start making some more specific decisions
confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost report
impact if it's got to something as they wouldn't damage just it's not so easy
