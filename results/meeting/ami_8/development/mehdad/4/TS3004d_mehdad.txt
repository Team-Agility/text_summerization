speech function and the colour
decided so In the channel buttons all the colours on it just write
back light thing the thing that lights up for the phone from the buttons just a green light of the light
wood rubber buttons mute buttons are together and at the place to use we are used to find
press it once the colour should switch to press again the colours
speech the scroll wheel and the slide you miss
fashioned kind blackboard style button you might as do it in normal computer
pretty if you slide it open that It lights
button supplements i didn't i'd i was wondering if this Special colour you can skip this one because it's all quite normal
choose what colour colour of changeable and also transparent or just transparent
function i use daily and it's not on the basic functions so all the non basic
information that you can easily decide what buttons will for what function and on off function text functions
fancy is more like the i have had a flashing lights and the colours and and that kinda
Scrolling the navigate the menu button
remote control as we have a list and a less than an easy to use because east

part like speech buttons speech you try to sell it counts redesign
time to did design that's the slides
material should be hard plastic is that the allows us to use that would be buttons non rubber buttons
basic colours are black or green or yellow
text next to the scroll wheel and it's very handy but the first time you get this thing in your side is not to use the scroll-wheel you must use seat for a turn
room that you can slide up and you cannot on the functions
basic colours very at twelve twelve the basic colours

meeting that one was pretty hard
remote cans sends like the code for seven hundred page like seven hundred and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred you will switch to your television back to texas
switch to the your scores playstation this utterance to use pretty
back later the foreign you're taking that from ipods or a particular device
yellow light do that yellow light
easy to use and it scroll-wheels you easy to use as if you have ever used different device
Change it between a beautiful a fancier look and feel is the outside the beautiful is really subjective for because it has to do lots with the colours
choose green the blue and red
tvs do collect all the page if you turn teletext on you set the seven hundred and you'd turn it off then the next and turn it on it still stays
kinda weird a we get this information
smartboards would be very to work with is worked really just not worth
point because it's twelve point three euros
fancy things for younger people you get to the static thing for older people

prices say it could be twenty euro then we would discourage
impossible to use it if you're left-handed so you because you can use your thumb
fancy look-and-feel and that's what the tracks the young group audience do need for forty
