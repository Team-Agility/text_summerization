easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
list of what functions are are going to to be on the screen and that and it screen menu screen
normal function the basic functions you normally press
menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
basic function if you are going to use the advanced one but a lot of options are going to press to the menu button
zapping which are a remote control you can press the menu button and then you are certainly into the the display
people use mobile phones and also have a screen is on top which function
users if we put leave lights on the button so that if you press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu in the lcd screen
design of the bus buttons for a for all the channels you can just push one button and one navigation button
press a button and the teacher a goes It it sends a signal to a chip which are translates
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional functionality
confirm a want to go one step back it's only two extra buttons
hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle of it says menu
reach a little bit for the power button but that's present channel volume selection are teletext
remote like this if you put it on the top on the side
screen is to reduce more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen
navigate the channels and left or right for the volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons
features the above forty people are not so interests and to not interested in the screen and the speech recognition
searching for channel five and phone account channel anything you want to move the only kind to channel
department do we need just the functional display and for curses
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
working off the top of my head and using my column common knowledge about the remote control options so we need to menus
remote and that you can choose what the design it's it doesn't make a remote control on noticed in your room
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option we want to put an lcd options
tvs in standby people of sixteen are quite used to technology so they adapted
problem mean you are you a car and channel and then it just say is which number do you want to save
younger users are more acquainted with these machines so they can use more advanced functions
save this and you just press the number in a remote and then say a confirm and then it's a it's easier
harder to if you have already program it to swap
idea because then it becomes clear about the extra two buttons or active
information came it was xx with all the steps in the remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
match the operating behaviour of the users are not afraid of a lot of functions or make the buttons as user-friendly
functions and on the Seems was it the target that's a group of forty
prefer we use the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
wary of space left and then put a logo should be like on top

microphone it can be very small phone are just are some stripes a little holes
television itself is also the options that brightness and screen settings mono stereo page
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
clear distinction between age groups concerning the features but we just have to build them in because they find
tvs automatically display the name which you get to the cable
threw it at transformer it's the signal gets a boost that and then sent to the tv on the tv and that if you will Translated into a function
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television with that usually three buttons and very hard
plug in the power cable when you go back to it to upper level which twos and focus
room that's it's actually a part of your interior of off you're designing your room
overview of what we discussed in our last Meeting
