encryption that it's pricing information but it tv device
focusing on all work and a place to waste actual remote control we need feel
portable device which will send messages to the main head and device to do particular operations and the total
aim at the end people read do we like to see zap
buttons we need is on off volume up or like to do might take a remote control do that sounds
