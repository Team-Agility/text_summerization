decided so In the channel buttons all the colours on it just write
back light thing the thing that lights up for the phone from the buttons just a green light of the light
wood rubber buttons mute buttons are together and at the place to use we are used to find

basic colours are black or green or yellow
text next to the scroll wheel and it's very handy but the first time you get this thing in your side is not to use the scroll-wheel you must use seat for a turn
years and some sometimes the numbers on the buttons are slide-away
