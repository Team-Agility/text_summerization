remote control was you all the time
sons speech recognition and it's cheap or a remote control
remote control we should be easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone
asked real people who are using real remote controlled every day and or any other to me that you see that the remote control but it seems that's so important but it's used as a remote control
profit remote control with a lot of buttons
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
general people change tv more often than batteries on their remote control
market of remote control they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention
simple button and speech recognition technology we take at least five euros or that you put some control we want to reduce
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
device on that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for do is a finding the tv
marriage are all The Brawl the way of saying the thing if we look back and not to look at a new remote controls it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole
converse to having you see the button and you can use your time on to it will take it some days to loan all these buttons
distinctive look and feel and you look they do Which people use need to the trains if we were in the people want to be different from their friends
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and battery and also we want to go for titanium design we should of rub
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser
chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive compared to lcd
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology inside
location and these people are really interesting on those features or they really like They're more want these fancy features
back light kills a lcd screen was different colours
rubber aspect might be important
recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology
Generally add developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface but for Possible instruction or users many all and so all that complex saying so it's come together with your tv and remote controls
colours Depending on what is around like what colours around and depending on the temperature
simple to program where the chip do we have only the plastic or that cd five or A chip
important because it's what is pretty more feasible in terms of sponginess
stick with two batteries solar smart
lighting we have many options in the market
problem is that this design we phone that we can't use the double record shapes
ready pretty to pay
sixty then you make a lot of money are you don't and you're out of business
bone shape it has to be more wrong than the More roo look natural
cc says if we want to have a small number of button we need to have a i'll put that says creaky what they are actions
interestingly this is the very most important thing it has to be fancy then to be with an that's the second thing you'd have to be it has to be technologically you do the tv
propose but the use of solar cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy would solar cells hand too late to just use simple battery
criterion the trends that we seen big cities like paris and milan it seems that this year think it should have a fruit and vegetable thing fruit and vegetable and spongy
selling point maybe it has to be the base
recogniser but we want to goals speaker independent or speaker
blue You use maybe for the addendum Nobody's expense
tomatoes and It's that easy they're rubber i some rubber parts
plastic we stick last time
big and there's so i'm just asking them the current trends according to them when the going to store is that when they asked there are friends mine has this and that euros And finally
decision we want to take on this meeting are on the them first and component concept so what energy and the media and the interface for energy
fruit these teams can be easily incorporate
reduce the cost on the display for the tv you information
remember has a nokia phone we can use the phone as a good to Example of work to it beeps back
small recap on how do we watch the trends there inventing it You're creating the trend i hope i'm going to try to help you want that this is more risky
meeting in thirty minutes
record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that Mark the user interface design
end we find out that it's not feasible
straight on these individual action g which are for them ram out a bit design
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
red goes faster than the life
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
source of information is the weather
body one call really come up with our forties
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning joe
puts lots of concentrate
