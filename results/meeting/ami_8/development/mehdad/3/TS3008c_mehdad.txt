telling me that when we build a remote control of of plastic or rubber the buttons to that the rubber double curved case is is it a three dimensional curve in the design
talk about the components of a remote control could just have a properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material we have to choose
lcd which is really pretty trendy but i don't think it will be too expensive
harder but also on the colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour look like it the plastic mold is in one colour and thus those cushion pets around it are in another colour set
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
talk about the materials it's a good idea to use the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights
fire i was thinking about the of the we still want the joystick if that's a good idea of maybe is a little bit Too much for twelve and a half Abduction

basic buttons to skip channels
programs you can zap to them with the page page down button skip the volume buttons but that goes to that they have to be large buttons sizes and i'm not or if they have to be ba or just small

drop it if you drop it back began a resolution with it the goal is backs industry a day when you're gonna something's
spongy thing already comes for in the in the cushions pets and things on this side
trendy too because that's the mode it it's a it's icsi a extent
