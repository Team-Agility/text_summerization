recognition it can take the function of a lot of a buttons
primary colours but only on the outside not on a button as a special colour and do the special colour for the buttons
press a light on the plus button
cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push buttons in an interest integrated scroll push button
point like let's drop all the buttons from here we still have to make some adjustments round
lose the back but it but let's say the only have to four arrows and the menu to go back and you so like that on click can you go one step back
possibilities are almost a limit is to build a menu you can have a button that activates a menu
lastly it can be a power button as soon as it powered
search for them in the in this in a screen in a menu
integrate the scroll wheel push buttons we control all the pushbuttons
Plastic with with the special colour for it so we can make it's a special colour
drop the speech recognition what it has at least one innovation
overview of channels in the screen and select the channel up and down volume etcetera
dropped just three more all of these have a clue so much functionality
dropped also on the double curve
ease of use was not very important when a remote control this place corporate logo
remote Control make use of technology technological innovation like lcd screen was more popular then then the speech recognition
remote control shows relevant the most used functions and they are relevant
cost and also is good in a marketing have to forty five close people
pen into it and then it came on to my screen it's that's about the same eighty one to ninety one percent and sixty to seventy
curved with top use still curved but from this side it's flat on the screen
click it you go into the menu was also a priori doubleclick
operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions
easy but it is that you don't have to move your fingers it is only one button
tire out there hasn't hand dynamo cost a lot of energy to keep the stream or things so i that isn't an option
arrange that then you have a id what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work
click on it goes into one feature call it just it click
evaluate the design with a seven point scale is falling the remote
target of has a weak spot for the fact was like a colour it's funny shape and live
shade doubly curve together or do we go for single curve design
moment we have fifteen buttons on the lcd screen on a advanced chip we need for the display what it's a feature
click on it activated way and when you move it here the difference of the trouble coming out so we're going into the sound
cost writing on a lot of functions in this question are related to pass it if you send some too negative
expensive think of it's almost same as keeping this and they can draw on the sit on the lower out of the screen we can make it big enough to actually draw
points of the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young use or source defined in colour and shape and the use of lcd
year it's a specially use so i to evaluate design is which we know indoor it you designers
easy to use this scroll is good fancy look-and-feel we're using fruit or vegetable trays primary colours sports like material
back to the drawing board has to be integrated into powerpoint for me is that you have to put in the pre made chunks as good as you can draw
hard the sponge like and the three d shape that would give it something you have a friend
silly we should have at this meeting before we start which price twenty
bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten
rno rr It's called find
option would be to go for the the sample speaker and which can use the regular chip But which is six euros in total doesn't matter
minutes you have ten minutes to the end of meeting
live was in that use kinetic energy is bones
rude to positive it actually means that the lower that's the lotus court a battery does thingies last forever
longer Because if in a way she is based on the initial user requirements the tense from the marketing research and marketing strategy of the company
pen is more intuitive we're all used to writing
finally have some idea powerpoint works so we'll take me for date to be able to make a normal powerpoint presentation
report of every decision we made so far And i try to catch it just for i received the excel sheet
celebrate you can just if you make finish my presentation interrupt so the finance that we have redesigned
move more to working together as a team because at first you make your individual contribution and then come here and you can already what the others have to make it may have finally
understood it right we have to count these numbers
stick with the green or are we gonna do blue
time do we have to deliver you port
account there's plenty of room for creativity
copy paste the picture
pleased with the process first poster
respond all sorts of the undo
