money working on screen menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing
press you testified button at the chip very visible very big
middle button it brings up down screen menu function of the power button
buttons rather if you press all at once they become channel changing volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle
repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons if you the volume button here if you push
buttons will be in special colour But that's important
work relevant people don't use a lot of buttons work together as a team the digital
corpora wanna know we could also have alternative colours not are not text but this is the general
hard to turn the machine of the time we had a lot of information and they're the same time
changing channel or that would be to switch machine
ipod you just every seconds you wanna go back in the menu button again it brings
answer every single curved case how many colours what the colours that's curved
case you can't send an infrared think a signal to that to find even know this is like your initial i'm initially
pictures of the different parts of the case that if it looks of the case out of college
tend to meetings and then people have a preference as far as feel and functionality
pretty hard to mess
clear and the size of point and i still the way i remember that i needed or for that point of the meetings
mine it was like would you prefer an lcd screen or multi-function remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria
how'd you get back to the main menu or submenus and so how'd
tera that's a pretty high learning curve it'll be easy
designs to be used even in your left hand or on your right hand if it's made of latex the rubber i it's funny
felt the first two meanings i was coming in with no information we got a menus
buttons are used the scrolling up and down for a list of justice you find the choice that he wants and you press
confusing but if we had all the buttons in black and a design and the outside and yellow that we're corpora
detailed design meeting in pretty excited
people it doesn't volume saved up volume up and volume down on the other side
fashionable can you make a remote it's pretty in technology in fashion and so those are the mexicans
talk about here it is it just evaluating how we create this project evaluated those kind a questionnaire to put down criticisms of But the process on the the final results
opinion but if we're now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle
play any text on the device like labels on the buttons all the product
chairs are like they have the option to do that and just take my own notes
lose i do think that on a scale of one to seven and how easy or hard was it two blues
order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit board in the chip because right gonna need a dash
ri and same scale for functionality is a functional
decisive person's the top to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes
year back and find it but anywhere also it's gonna stand up like this on your table if you want it to if i made about the bottom flat
buy and more market marketing expert could not agree with the marketing

people should really base they're both sort fruit and vegetables in really good like creativity
link i what the side i would just get slide subtitles
idea of kinetic battery that's expensive but we have a sample chip
hold it you they're like this in your left it or you switch
worried at the end of the last meeting that we were getting we didn't have enough an information to make firm decisions
big market evaluation even just have it one set of source in a word
son and the user wary net i know you're saying you're a little bit nervous about that i it's a remind
distinctive that it's not just like another be the technology around your house
