pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
recognise does the remote the speech control concepts
screen they don't need that big of cpu
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
work with the lcd screen was a rather small
decided to have to remotes to the size
easier to do in colour than a shape
hand there and then you want touch the screen
people all time boring
button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons
meets more the young people than older people
elderly people just plain old because we decided
called like what's the trends from past years
radio button you are pressing the right moment
rubber rubber is still the rubber isn't fancy
option to use as a in a rather simple chip
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
menu for button channel volume we should also be enough for easy
colours it was the slogan and the corporate colour
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
larger it's not really on scale then to work an option
touch options you can't go back
colours like reading brown light out dark red deeper read
settings menu to look up some some channels on your television
square shape sit around got on the round
called cults settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu
rubber which you can look and feel weird
hard part of this or softer rubber should be soft
big difference between young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
remembered and menu to go back from the floor
young people they liked fruity colours Innovative all the colleges you blue red yellow
user interface are also some questions about the concepts you have some ideas
easy way to a program that you say record
navigate through menu great with the scroll
cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
chip and we have that's it's possible to scratchy
simple
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium
point we already decided that on the previous meeting
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
square and round corners put a little in the middle
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
noticed that be in this file design and user interface there are going to work together on for a foundering a smartboard
question mark how much we spy thing with energy
lasting not not be anti it's a two minutes
slow you can make a versus the microphone
show some points on which we it should take a decision
ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
question and three seconds later you say the answer
recharge through docking station
Volume selection
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
prepared a little presentation will we on your side
lay flat down on table
edit issue to remove degrees
bike little rr and r and rr on the top
