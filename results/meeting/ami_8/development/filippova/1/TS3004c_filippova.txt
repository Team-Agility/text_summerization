shape than a normal remote control
ordinary remote controls as good morning remote control
document be sent to the station of the remote control
curved remote controls we must use rubber buttons
basic buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons
top buttons are wish there should be on top
smaller remote control you can cd or you have to but you reach both both sides
Basic remote control from our plastic then the buttons
switch channel up button above the numbers and switch channel down button
Light switches on if you use a button
difference if you put this this switch channels on side of it on top
volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake
fancy because of the lights on the bottom that's what difference
image of ti part so focuses on these two parts
green colour the backlight
important aspect is that you must make it fancy and it looks original
numbers should be in the bottom and the switch channel in the middle
aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative
easy to know me for a push to the yup
difference is that we use a scroll wheel
buttons normal rubber like normal ordinary buttons soft
basic care colour fronts
blinking light on my phone and change the colour
integrated in the chip so if we use speech
drop it you wanna change the volume only if you use your finger
deciding yellow and it did the top and black
sense if you put it somewhere in the chances the beautiful scroll
telephone also have a lcd or speech recognition
recognition We i don't think we should put it on top band
expensive most expensive chip if we use an lcd
colours like green blue red so Flashy kinda colours the shape
regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced
nnn is a as round of a soft material
de curved is like front to the back and three d curves
original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod And and three players mobile phones
battery context like normal batteries just a rechargeable batteries expense
slide in the docking station
display requires an advanced chip
shape should be curved So round shapes not nothing square
strange that i receive information on speech recognition
falls the front so we put on the market
personal thing is that we should go more modern look and d player
product you by your get one and more basic or you can choose
low if we will a lot of room to put in as logo
show you the And i the the menu to that what's it called
User interface
kinetic a like but the polls watch so it operates
design so i did some searching on the internet
people you still have older people it's only annoying
zapping is the highest priority
target group we talk about was young public
features and then that this is a point of discussion
small electronic units will give a standard answer of should recognise the question sample sensor sample
