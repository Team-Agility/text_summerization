present this presentation that is what we want the remote control
speak into the into the remote control the remote
people go through by as a remote control
remote control Being one or beyond thing and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition
extra internet connection to use a remote control
restrict the remote control it you get lost
difference Between the them the first know control
remote market or what so the remote or because the cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
control but i have new you we inputs for about that the peaks
pretty wide range of remote controls on ep means talk on which is a customer know written review side
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
functions that are controlled through the lcd screen
younger people are they are more interested they incorporating new technologies for young peoples
simplest thing the remote to change the channel
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
application and then shape of the buttons like say the number of buttons
list people are awarded about the rrs ieds
point to To find out can we increases the price
speech recognition technology does mean sitting on the remote
work it does work was supposed to work on and so on the working
showing now how easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
People so complain because they all have the same size of the voters four buttons which are not betty
list of programmed an lcd screen just for changing channel
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition
tv or we have control of the tv then we can actually display
groups or you could even have some buttons like on the sides
speech recognition if you can leave it sitting there on that Remote
feeling is that it's Rick regarding costs digits we have and target price it's not possible to goals two lcd
speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros
programmes on off and you what channels already what's on If you have a list
user interface could be off more than one type
users as our marketing expert should be for some specs
problem means then the user has to understand each of that functionality
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared of lcd
press a button to talk and the tvt v set
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology
requirements like a big courting all those things are required and for wise
cd screen except for the really main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons
zine time to start time all the programs
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
design should feed the hand shape and it should not be really small
internet connectivity would be to have this program driven interface rather than the channel number
tracking to choose a wheel is quite handy
pretty comfortable if you want to get this and on top
lcd you need more requirements you need that internet
speak buttons out of something which is really everybody's the red
hope that next meeting about the functional design
wheel which is it's a really important design aspects
discussion next meeting you have the task you have to work
brings us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet capability
find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
opinion there My and all these mine though shouldn't be bit smaller
master a very easy is assigned they could be sold
sounds in english to send funny and spanish
forces you had a company which is putting the fashion in electronics
message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting similarly there are different interfaces
selling the potential of the device You'll do we have problems
mount the for the naming we see fault
final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
