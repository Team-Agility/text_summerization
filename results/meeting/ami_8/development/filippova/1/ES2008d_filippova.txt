menu system and the middle button how to select
press you testified button at the chip very visible very big
middle button it brings up down screen menu and money
buttons rather if you press all at once they become channel changing buttons
easily adaptable to either hand you can push the buttons
buttons will be in special colour But that's important
remember really we discussed of the buttons work
offer in an in at least three different colour
time we had a lot of information and they're the same time
channels or that would be to switch machine
button again it brings you back one model
single curved case how many colours what the colours
control would with the device like that actually help you to find
case material we just have one colour on there but the cases
people have a preference as far as feel and functionality
pretty hard to mess
points but it wouldn't have a side for each point
rubber on we could happen have a remote control
how'd you get back to the main menu
tera that's a pretty high learning curve it'll be easy
Hand if it's made of latex the rubber i it's funny
Mimi really like i they're in together powerpoint of no information
find the choice that he wants and you press
rate and the design else that we set
detailed design meeting in pretty excited
volume make sense if we had a larger group
pretty in technology in fashion to get the real
cost than the budget to the project evaluated
middle so i'm gonna say it's like if the rate that's just my opinion
difficult to just have an external device like labels on the buttons all the product
chairs are like they have the option to do that and just take my own notes
losing i do think that on a scale of one to seven and how easy or hard to lose
inspiration about circuit board in the chip To make it make a noise
ri and same scale for functionality is a functional
decisive person's the top to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes
back and find it but anywhere also it's gonna stand
market research of them and threatened that shortly we could've taken that into account
favourite channels that you've selected this middle
creating your prototypes you did you work together or did you like to separate projects
shape so that it fits in your hands nicely
homing no idea screen we don't have a teacher
finally it to production evaluation criteria look at the finances
email saying that powerpoint minutes will be complementary rather than like repeating
speaker creative enough to think of toggle switch
sides i would just get slide subtitles
kinetic battery that's expensive but we have a sample chip
hold it you they're like this in your left it or you switch
summit in rio do the job of making firm decisions at the end
big market evaluation even just have it one set of source in a word
net i know you're saying you're a little bit nervous about that i it's a remind
distinctive that it's not just like another be the technology around your house
yellow and grey but on the slogan's and blue are the web page
minutes so that it will include all the agenda and all that fifteen
excel sheet they were actually gonna calculate the costs under twelve fifty euro
sad and get me links to the corporate website
solve the gatekeeper grip to it doesn't ring finger
pen was a little distracting for me personally
small but still like queue but dean
lightning bolt or not very cute
tps so It in total deep
