double scroll buttons you can as you scroll wheels
scroll scroll wheels i also have some information
personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control
watching a movie how many times you take the remote control
scroll wheels that's the speaker the speech recognition
scroll is work with one one curved case
images on the rubber double curved get a case
volume button is on the side but do you touch
spongy feel and that's what you get with rubber
scenario where you would use the scroll button
colouring is important and soft materials
chips we use the regular chip for the sample
high-tech and just or weird Shape So i suggest
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
market would like something titanium casing
Integrating a scroll bar on this side
fruit you have to colours We have to simple design
banana a telephone telephone from siemens the yellow rubber telephone it's a rubber
colours it should be a full colour cover
simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved
voice recognition item we were searching for this sample
older group a step further dark colours simple shapes from the material
yellow
simple regular an advanced chip which is a bit cheaper
finishing this is what's on the edge what you feel
buttons so it's just like a mouse you can score
fruit and vegetables are important for clothing shoes and furniture
voice recognition you say i were you can program words like volume
feel of the material has to be spongy
sample sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip
imagine it's a bit like a wave form
material but we're since we're cost reading room The younger group likes a more colourful
suggest that the corporate colours are great and yellow
cell phones which exchangeable cover with the rubber finishing
source which brings me to the different energy
kinetic thing it is it's possibility is more sense
tv when you have to make some energy kinetic energy and all the wise
integrate lcd displays there's no way you can integrated scroll wheels
curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
Ease of use it is important but innovation
issue i addressed at the beginning of the meeting the voice function we with the infrared issue
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar
phase source and is the design of the look and feel The user interface design
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
space in our finance i would say do integrated
bet i understood that the market is decide as a little older
lcd display really need the advanced version which is a bill
piece of this action to it's that's really the mute
imagine it's very goal to talk to a device with you have two points to another device
devices like at telephones and are radio pocket radios
personal coach will give you more information
watch in a display or which channel you have chosen like that often the amount of volume
watch you watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of energy then the shaking
walls the reef like the infrared light
forty minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
talk with our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion
afraid is not possible to print a picture or the size
