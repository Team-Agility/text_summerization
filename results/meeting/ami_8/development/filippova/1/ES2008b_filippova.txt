hundred a new remote control is quite subjective experience
users using a remote control functions i will disclose
designing a new television remote controls in the analysing
talk about the technical functions design objectives
chip which is also controlled by the user
personally what i want from a remote control is a device that simple
focusing on the designers people specifically said that it's not remotes were ugly seventy
people are only using ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote
working design how the apparatus can fulfil its function
lots of buttons and the relevant the polls buttons hired
button them i'm gonna buy a new remote
sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls
chip that works with the user interface is critical
converts electrical energy source people don't wanna be changing
people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume
frozen he can show me to pick up the remote
work or infrared bulb which will then bring
older people didn't really care for voice recognition
pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
type numbers working on in terms of age
tv that's just impossible to use or maybe broke
careful that doesn't impede it the chip transmitting information
desire for voice recognition was inverse be related to age
mentioned things like voice recognition but at the price
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
wind One large accessible buttons for the essential
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
find out find a way of striking a balance
talk a little bit about functional requirements that just received
hides all the complicated buttons
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television
disadvantages you can't use it say to freeze the television screen
simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
talk about our functions and our target group
prominent as the main features and price as you mentioned
clear idea of an lcd screen was brought
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the people mention that was the biggest
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
receiver and in my opinion infrared
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
focus in and those volumes and channel changing
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes
battery and that that the chip takes the data
price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce
Sit simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics
coffee at the end user is gonna want from this product
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease
minutes i emailed them to you and also putting
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
twenty five euro
Switch the quality a quality of the chair
time you'll be able to access more of the website
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
white or thereabouts draw
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
