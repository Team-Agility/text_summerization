easy to find your remote control
design we can make a design for those only those buttons
remote controls and let them buttons
important thing what a remote control reports
power buttons and use one time and the volume
ten percent the buttons
method of the remote control is just a function of remote
lots of people complain they kind can find the remote control
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
round buttons should be the truth
people would bother walking to tv and press that button because they are lost the remote
tv set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions
channel nineteen you only have that button
remote going to look not any user interface designer
multi function and remote control but many possibilities a great feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
channel selection is the most important
include other in a stiff Functions
decided to implement seemingly easy design
easy to use we my coat rack
support teletext is out of date and the internet
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find
cheaper that the chip set a circuit board
people do not use all the extra features
focus on younger people because it's easy
buttons trendy design lightning what and the sound
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
connected to free things user interface
personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user
device can have communicate with almost every tv set
drop the voice recognition the data
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost circuit board
connected to the sender which generates
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment
find a balance between the advanced techniques
sebastian will find the one solution
generates messages using infrared light diodes
devices which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
fancy lights and all that fancy
hope personal coach is we'll assist
production cost rr in just a part of the equipment
expensive and they're hard to implement
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
light for that when you move the stick
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger than they have forty which is important
save costs by not implementing a lot of functions
ten digits but keep the program
important point is that we really should use energy friendly components
career curious to of the market We'll feel about such a product
time to perform are individual work
part is forty percent of the market
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
market is to tell million units
Reports or to spend response
discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call
home station for base station next to see this a little antenna
minutes made the project documents folder
opened the cd rom box accidentally
signal from where do you execute the this in south
case we have to metal contacts
