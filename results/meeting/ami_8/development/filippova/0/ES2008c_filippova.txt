lots of buttons for the features
push buttons but i'm it intrigued
hand and you press the buttons are fun
buttons could be shaped like different fruits
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
onscreen menu then we can scroll
buttons remain things but then i go back
people they blinked on the important aspects of a remote control
decision on the remote control get a certain amount of a light
menu display that comes up on the television
case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
ipods and things right now have touch scroll buttons
buttons changing the volume favourite channels is applicable
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control
determine what the essential functions in the device
interface and we'll come back to the chip
simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip
lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
people think about this kinetic battery idea
main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen
tend to watch tv in the dark
information i have no idea of the scroll wheel
model is a going to be for user interface list of device
solar battery although there are slight complications with solar battery
kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches
advantages and disadvantages if you have an lcd display
simple device itself is useful purpose
double curved case it can have any titanium
main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
type of battery you find in porches from about fifty years ago flashlights
number of different choices for a design concept and start
switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
user face we're gonna have to decide the interface
fun doing it components design ri
spongy latex it's a spongy is the end
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end
international be on we said but for all age groups different functions of it objectives
worried about protecting on the inside
fruit and vegetable colours we could colour
minutes from the functional design we sat our target
specific question some has to email
shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
information on how should report are produced
fifty minutes left of the meeting
fickle a or latex cases that it's hard to protect inside but it's covered
point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
work together on a prototype using modelling clay
fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
opening a box you just peeler in the remote
simple regular advanced chip-on-print the chip-on-print
start looking like Was group it is a hoax who can afford
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
mind that these are the options
attend a certain amount of space
