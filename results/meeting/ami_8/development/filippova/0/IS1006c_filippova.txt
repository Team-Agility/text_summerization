remote control was you all the time
remote controls and speech recognition
easy to use as a remote control
probe provides currently a remote control
profit remote control with a lot of buttons
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
general people change tv more often than batteries on their remote control
market of remote controls they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention
simple button and speech recognition technology we take at least five euros or that you put some control we want to reduce
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
heard that it seems that speech recognition
futuristic hear it would control with angles and the titanium back
button i the weirdest maybe one of these buttons
people the young people want to be different from their friends
batteries for Really like batteries and we will good price
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser
chip technology and it's more expensive
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology inside
location and these people are really interesting on those features
back light kills a lcd screen was different colours
rubber aspect might be important
recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology
concept of the interface Generally add developed
paints that can change the colour
spongy on one that animal A chip
titanium or if we choose spongy
follow smart should be some not too complicated
lighting we have many options in the market
problem is that this design we phone that we can't use the double record shapes
ready pretty to pay
sixty then you make a lot of money
bone shape i got was shape
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a i'll put that says creaky what they are actions
important thing it has to be fancy
battery or we can use traditional solar cells hand
friends you can travel from golf to furniture so it might be fruit and vegetable
selling point maybe it has to be the base
recogniser but we want to goals speaker independent or speaker
blue You use maybe for the addendum Nobody's expense
mall with the rubber is expensive
plastic we stick last time
big and there's so i'm just asking them the current trends according to them when the going to store is that when they asked there are friends
component to use for energy and the media and the interface for energy
fruit these teams can be easily incorporate
include video i was d display
remember has a nokia phone which changeable panels
watching the trends there inventing it You're creating the trend i hope
meeting
record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that mark and then sandy
end we find out that it's not feasible
action g which are for them ram out a bit design
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
red goes faster than the life
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
source of information is the weather
