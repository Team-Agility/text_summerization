discuss And come to a decision on our remote control
draw out there that thought about personalising the remote control
single function television remote control which can be used for several entertainment devices
remote control which is to send messages to the television
eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control
research fit be if it's to have a remote control channel
percent of remote control users said they zap a lot zapping meeting
single function just a television
eat it should be user friendly and unique user-friendly people
functional design of the apparatus is the fact the apparatus
multi function controls can be difficult to use as a lot shape of buttons can be confusing
eighty percent of users say they only use ten percent
negate the whole remote control thing because of people can activate
design as as having that would complicated a lot wall
room in the project folder to make a more original design we'll have more money
relevance of that button is nine and ten so people are officially
constant light up on the remote control thing lights up for ten seconds when it's touch
infrared will actually be sent through the chip to Be received by the chip on television set Channel
remote controls must have our incorporate our logo what colour
company to do that for as they would be a responsibility
large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote control
design purposes the lighting of thing might be better because the dark material has a funny colour of our our company buy
clock you have an lcd screen like a computer screen
cells that but then you'd like a pattern and down button for the channel selection
medals or would we contribute another group we're targeting young adults
discuss this late so just a little bit more before we close
button that you press the page numbers like for the menu
easier to make it compatible with different brands of television devices
market if we want to concentrate on fifteen or twenty five else we could go with the fancy but if we wanna make fifty
significant number decreases that's with all its interestingly enough twenty
functional requirements of that was to produce have coffee quickly
tested and it just lights up then it gives the thing close
start to get a new tv set each and all the time
minimise a balance we're not gonna make them actually larger
decisions is that the management suggesting use of the internet
volume selection to ten at and it's used on average
buttons which we're all familiar with when we using a mobile phone
hour and as about high relevance a six point
screen that's holding something together could expand then it would force all the components that part the parts
providing international university universally accepted product responsibility to get rid
changing it so as you said we wanna durable but in that's not gonna write
glow in the dark fluorescent whatever system it's go ahead does everyone interest
properties the smart materials flat specific how ease of medals have a shape memories
write off the lcd option
interestingly enough twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount that would are willing to pay extra
bringing to the meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of a design
happy you have no objection back to respect the research
face plates end of this to start making more complicated
trends that are going on in the public even be the who's famous
approach i have to see if that can meet our financial goals
selling adhesive that you could x to come to the back of any set that would be not very intrusive
components is will be how with the wheel actually work
investigate how much that will cost us cost the company
'em bits and the basic jobs you can wear out with time all not usable they might be like Bill that's going to scrap metal
sounds a construct a ball metal it allows for recycling materials
presentation will be looking at is poppies presentation tonight
individual components could be easily separated and some could be we used some could be recycled
raise what's the energy source it could be a battery like rechargeable
running banner underneath
highly a quality machinery in if it machinery
