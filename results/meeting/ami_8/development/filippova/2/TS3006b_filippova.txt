basic function if you are going to use the advanced options
zapping which are a remote control you can press the menu button and then you are certainly into the the display
people use mobile phones and also have a screen on top

phones options are activated based on some so for options
people can say what's that one that's my remote control
week or on the channel volume selection present the numbers present
younger users are more acquainted with these machines so they can use more advanced functions

working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
features are hidden in the screen with the clear menu
tvs automatically display the name which you get to the cable
signal of certain spatial frequencies it's a counters one it shows on your tv
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television it's difficult
screen this you been option to go back to it to upper level the finally
consequences on the marketing a part you don't have to design
overview of what we discussed in our last Meeting
news flash also stated that so it should control only one device only your television
product should reach a new market which is the customers below forty
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information
