pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
important thing people like to last year was that the remote control
blc d screen they don't need that big of cpu
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
main you can fit the lcd screen it's quite innovative
decided to have to remotes to the size
changing colours will be easier to do in colour than a shape
hand there and then you want touch the screen
people all time boring
button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons
older people can see it because it is the unique
elderly people just plain old because we decided
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes colours Material
fat people would effect thinking of press three buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button
rubber the total piece of rubber is still the rubber isn't fancy
option to use as a in a rather simple chip
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
menu for button channel volume we should also be enough for easy
colours it was the slogan and the corporate colour physical forward
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
larger it's not really on scale then to work an option
touch options you can't go back
colours like reading brown light out dark red deeper read
settings menu to look up some some channels on your television
shapes it is something between the square shape of round
called cults settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu
rubber which you can look and feel weird
hard part of this or softer rubber should be soft
big difference between young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
remembered and menu to go back it's a big button go back
young people they liked fruity colours Innovative all the colleges you blue red yellow
user interface are also some questions about the concepts you have some ideas
easy to have it something like but and minus here the sofa here Minus
navigate through menu great with the scroll
cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal plain
colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
pay chip and we have that's it's possible to scratchy
simple
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium
switch it just from the previous meeting and busy writing
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
square and round corners put a little in the middle
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
noticed that be in this file design and user interface there are going to work together on for a foundering a smartboard
sense that it you ask you give a question mark
lasting not not be anti it's a two minutes to accomplish
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
show some points on which we it should take a decision
ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
recharge through docking station
Volume selection
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
