remote market or what so the remote or because the cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
control but i have new you we inputs for about that the peaks
pretty wide range of remote controls on ep means talk on which is a customer know written review side
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
possibility is to download programme information into the lcd screen
younger people are they are more interested they incorporating new technologies for young peoples
simplest thing the remote control does is it just change that change the channel
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
application and then shape of the buttons like say the number of buttons
people are what it about the shape of the remote control

automatic speech recognition technology does mean sitting on the remote
work it does work was supposed to work on and so on the working
showing now how easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
People so complain because they all have the same size of the voters four buttons which are not betty
list of programmed an lcd screen just for changing channel
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition
tv or we have control of the tv then we can actually display
groups or you could even have some buttons like on the sides

relation to know you would be cheaper as compared of lcd
press a button to talk and the tvt v set
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology
requirements like a big courting all those things are required and for wise
cd screen except for the really main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons
programme you could have a start time as or this Actions
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
design should feed the hand shape and it should not be really small
internet connectivity would be to have this program driven interface rather than the channel number
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
pretty comfortable if you want to get this and on top
requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
speak buttons out of something which is really everybody's the red
