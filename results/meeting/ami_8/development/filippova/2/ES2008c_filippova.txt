lots of buttons for the features
cost we should just go for push buttons but i'm it intrigued
press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
buttons could be shaped like different fruits
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
onscreen menu of your channel traces then you can scroll
buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting
people they blinked on the important aspects of a remote control
decision on the remote control get a certain amount of a light
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu
case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
ipods and things right now have touch scroll buttons to scroll
buttons for your favourite channels and the volume control could double
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control
determine what the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
interface and we'll come back to the chip
simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip
lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen
watching tv if you're changing the brightness tuning the tv and the button to switch
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel
model is a going to be for user interface list of device
solar battery although there are slight complications with solar battery
options of using the kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches
advantages and disadvantages if you have an lcd display would have to be quite small
member of that this is the device going to work
imagining like double curved case it can have any titanium
main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
type of battery you find in porches from about fifty years ago flashlights
number of different choices for a design concept and start
switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
user interface we have to decide on whether i have a scroll
examine each element separately but we're designing
spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end
international be on we said but for all age groups different functions of it objectives
find a way to protect like the chip
fruit and vegetable or like i don't like a carrot source
armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on how should report are produced
minute or if you the minutes left of the meeting
fickle a or latex cases that it's hard to protect inside but it's covered
point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work
fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre
simple regular advanced chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
start looking like Was group it is a hoax who can afford
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
attend a certain amount of space
presentation i have one more slide before we close but in that side
saved it this in the shared project
