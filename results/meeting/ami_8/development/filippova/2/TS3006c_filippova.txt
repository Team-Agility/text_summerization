buttons which can hide in the back button and a menu button
colours you where you can make it so make the colours that let's beneath the buttons
press a button then you can disable the colour leds for people
colour also for the more for the older people are bit colour blind
prefer to be even keep the simple chip just for pressing buttons
basic print
buttons also help because of they're only lit during interaction
basic look and feel design for the for the buttons
background the bright colour colours to give you an idea
menu button to flip this open it will hold expected
sixty fifth a five thousand colour so you don't lose
important thing i was think about this speech just for the basic options for the simple buttons
primary colours we can creative that that the leds on the remote control
control things in the middle the arrows
falls on the other side it so that the buttons
decided to go for the pushbuttons for the arrow button that you scroll
case that there's an menu under the menu
green actually the easiest to discriminate even for colour blind
reread got the basic functions and here where it's most reachable
dark blue or so the contrast with the fruit of texas are pretty
responsible enough to have a mobile phone has to work for the remote control
single curve someone did mention and double curved it's tearing
components there's a lot of options are for the menu
important aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative
appeal to the young dynamic people want soft primary colours which looks like fruits
back light on it but use it in a user interaction
picture of doubly curved case there's the traditional uncurved flat hard case single curved
easier to hold for both hands but also that you can reach the buttons
hardware inside which is so it has to have some basic shape
chip Is easiest to implement for the production they can print
yellow
vds but this is the simple functions will be visible

fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothing and shoes and furniture and it feels material
speech display it sounds everything that in your minutes i wrote
fancy look-and-feel instead of the current functional look and feel

match the speech commands if the functions that are already present
pop up screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches
read i read let's and blue
decided kinetic provision of energy source would be more expensive
energy source chip type case type and s user interface
partly but you have to train on the number or the sign
discourage You two are going to work on smart board
covered in some thin rubber it will look cheap
shapes are curved and not us all it straight lines
call meaning so that's a dark
sell it for twenty five euro a piece that's gonna be difficult
harm it so it's the perfect combination
problem so my point of attention is a space be disbarred
knew that i didn't have time so copy and paste
Track the pictures into the slide so i don't have examples
fingers have to fit underneath
shows for the battery and traditional and that's the most obvious easiest choice
factors involved in choosing the components
scared about pounds get out the floor and breaking
evaluation don't have to evaluate yet which can make a procedure which to fall
