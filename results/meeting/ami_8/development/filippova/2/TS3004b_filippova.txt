remote control just sends come on space six months to to television
remote control eight percent use would spend more money when a remote controls
points we had last meeting was should be you universal Remote control
remote control becomes a green if you press a button
room so we have to understand what buttons are used to to make it universal
special all the plo eight people might be bigger buttons
people elderly people what they use what they want on remote control
press the one that circuit chip knows what button is pressed
teletext option Maybe we have to skip
light under the and the numbers anything do if you press
small light around the button you push so you see green
missed did i miss any other buttons those buttons
normal be put in the simple buttons on the top
channel above ten normally you can press
period of an five seconds to press those two buttons
simple standards So standardise the methods like a know remote controls
market you can now buy for twenty euros a remote control
divide between functions you often used like maybe switch channels all time
automatic only search function for each television so you want buttons
find out what people use maybe just use questionnaires on the internet
hard to remember what channel connects to what favourite it what channel
problem to because you have to be fast enough maybe the elderly people
fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons
shopping is cr or a tv control hanging that it stands
main people of interest of this company are forty plus people
teletext is become outdated since the popularity of internet and elderly
buttons the design is most important you can do integrate
older people are more critical where they spend their money
full like your it's already said only ten percent on the top
system so when you clap your hands it will beep
screen green

functions i could think of volume channels the basic a call that number but This one two three cetera the text there's options basic on off and find
work them and does it have to work only in english or in dutch
lights up everything light this invisible and this one's producing infra-red lights emitting diode
configuring the spectrum just chip is trying to switch off the television
numbers only numbers for the more nothing but only the numbers want to twenty
optional like we discussed like ipod different colours
recognition about you said one and the television turns
receptor in the tv senses that's room
experiments was about gadgets like the speech recognition you can just throw
chips sends out that's our to the infrared bulb
hard to realise that we have short time and spongy
chip for is producing the pattern Like a morse code
required because it like in a mobile phone the phone
product should reach a new market this custom and our do you wanna forty so it should be flashy
Red so it shows that like something's
circuit as close to produce is the pattern
report about an experiment with a lot of users said they zap
method i used is search the web just web page provided
main thing is the usability that's when we can make it a special product or own style
colours you can choose blue or yellow
marketing report from other side
