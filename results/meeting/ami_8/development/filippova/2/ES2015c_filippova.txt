back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control
flexible design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
simple would go with the push button
links into the different depends on what type of buttons
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
choice of buttons what functions will show
important aspect is the remote should that the remote control
discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic and the casing is rubber
meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design
remote control would be cheaper design like look at the basic
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
stick graphical user you must need some presentation for the graphics like an lcd
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television
audio because we how other televisions work
change the buttons so one same colour it's face it's generated
explain what the user interface to make it more trendy
phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons
ousted a kinetic energy saving see all producing the energy
end so more internal casing and the rubber coating which is on the case
mind more design an hour more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons
numbers of the channels volume and you cannot any power
advanced would have to go with a lcd c display
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates in this meeting
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
Screen settings was use zero point five times an hour
work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job
working this have to shake it a bit and revitalise
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house cat our dog
difficult if it's a rubber plate going on top or would stay
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
work with rubber has already given the market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
rubber which might be mall ideal for the anti rsi
regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
including the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip
circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
top or a light up ideas to combat these problems
source is not necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg eating
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television
Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
powerpoint i can't remember what it's got at the components
cutting edge technology wise kinetic
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty
looked at the design reports from previous years here real
keyboard so the numbers are like a keyboard you pressing
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
reconvene in thirty minutes it back
shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real swimming or a store
method was mainly web-based research this time around i also spoke
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user
stick to tv based maybe tv in the dark
problem with international a appeal if we have audio
information We need to start making some more specific decisions
shorter report
impact if it's got to something as they wouldn't damage just it's not so easy
