easy to find your remote control button remote control function
design we can make a design for those only those buttons
luxury a remote control and the advanced remote controls and let them buttons
important thing for people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control
power buttons and use one time and the volume
ten percent the buttons
method of the remote control is just a function of remote
lots of people complain they kind can find the remote control
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button
people would bother walking to tv and press that button because they are lost the remote
control the tv set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions
channel nineteen you only have that button or change the channel switching
user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
multi function and remote control but many possibilities a great feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
channel selection is the most important or volume and programme selecting
function at the Functions decide it and our target audience
multi function the technical design or energy save design we should really implement
opinion the it be easy to use we my coat rack
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find
fewer buttons you have that's the cheaper the circuit the chip
mikes young people do not use all the extra features
focus on younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
buttons trendy design lightning what and the sound from other sounds
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
user interface connect to chip which is connected to free things user interface
personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user
device can have communicate with almost every tv is a bus with nancy
costs and especially for the voice recognition has the main it stand
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost circuit board
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment
find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness
sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light
hebrew i bet devices which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
fancy lighting and techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
buy personally we should infer use infrared
production cost rr in just a part of the equipment
main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger than they have forty which is important
expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten digits on the phones
important point is that we really should use energy friendly components
career curious to of the market We'll feel about such a product
thirty minutes of time to perform are individual work for ball When it's fun
younger parts off the market isn't the forty percent we Want to sell
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
older you might want to constrain that portion market is to tell million units
Reports or to spend response
dark concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call
home station for base station next to see this a little antenna
minutes i make into the shared folder
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
signal from where do you execute the this in south
case we have to metal contacts
