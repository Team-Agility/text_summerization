lots of buttons for the features
cost we should just go for push buttons which is what real reaction
press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
buttons could be shaped like different fruits
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
onscreen menu of your channel traces then you can scroll down on the scrolling
matter how many buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting
people they blinked on the important aspects of a remote control
decision on the remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
important features for a remote is seen a menu button so that we can access
button to switch off in case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll an actual i got ipods scroll button
buttons to select your favourite channels and the channel flipping and then the other white
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control the television from your armchair
determine what the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
interface and we'll come back to the chip
simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip in an lc
lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main
ri uses for buttons to me to move around so range of settings so on a small lcd screen
watching tv if you're changing the brightness tuning the tv and the button to switch
intrigued by the idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
model is a going to be for user interface list of device
solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
money into the like the kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches
advantages and disadvantages if you have an lcd display would have to be quite small
essentially we need to choose how is this device this is an ipod from apple
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case it can have any titanium
main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time i am imagining
type of battery you find in porches from about fifty years ago flashlights
number of different choices for a design concept and start
switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
user face we're gonna have to decide the interface the tape and the supplements
examine each element separately but we're designing
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
international be on we said but for all age groups different functions of it objectives
find a way to protect like the chip
ideas had it possibly use these and how to use a fruit and vegetable colours
minutes a new type things you look and feel design meeting and it's sending
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on how should report are produced
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
fickle a or latex cases that it's hard to protect inside but it's covered
point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options that we have for manufacturing
attend a certain amount of space
presentation i have one more slide before we close but in that side
saved it this in the shared project
