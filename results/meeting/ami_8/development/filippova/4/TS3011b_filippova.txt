add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to change the channel
dec design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
unique feature of a remote control and the advanced remote controls and let them buttons
important thing for people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control
power buttons and use one time and the volume
ten percent the buttons
remote controls the multi function of remote control is to send messages to the television set
device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find the remote control
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button
people would bother walking to tv and press that button because they are lost the remote
tv set would have such a button you would have to walk you tv
channel nineteen you only have that button or change the channel or to not the volume
remote going to look not any user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
multi function and remote control but many possibilities a great feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
channel selection you have them to most important or volume selection and the teletext
list of Functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all functions available device
implementing this a function the technical design or energy save design we should really implement
buttons like that which are easy to use rc is the best one possibility
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet is replacing teletext
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find
cheaper that the chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
volume because maybe people do not always want to use the voice
focus on younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
user interface connect to chip which is connected to free things user interface
personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user in what state
device can have communicate with almost every tv is a bus with nancy
decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition has the main it stand
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment
find a balance between the advanced new techniques and the user friendliness
sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
hebrew i bet devices which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
money we say if we using this we can use for an average fancy lights
buy personally we should infer use infrared
production cost rr in just a part of the equipment
main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger than they have forty which is important
disadvantages that there are so concerns about the costs by not implementing a lot of functions
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten digits on the phones
specially designs and energy friendly components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components
career curious to of the market We'll feel about such a product
thirty minutes of time to perform are individual work for ball When it's fun
younger parts off the market isn't the forty percent to make the five million
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
older you might want to constrain that portion market is to tell million units
Reports or to spend response
dark concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
home station for base station next to see this a little antenna
minutes i make into the shared folder
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
signal from where do you execute the this in south
case we have to metal contacts
