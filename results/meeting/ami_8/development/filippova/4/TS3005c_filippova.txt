pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
important thing people like to last year was that the remote the speech control
blc d screen if you make screen for called as matter
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
main you can fit the lcd screen as large as the remote control itself yelling
decided to have to remotes to the size
changing colours will be easier to do in colour than a shape
hand there and then you want touch the screen
people all time boring
small because you have how much nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the lcd screen
meets more the young people can see it because it is the unique
elderly people just plain old because we decided
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly people
fat people would effect thinking of press three buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button
wood rubber rubber that makes it easy to to tune that's it's of colour
option to use as a in a rather simple chip
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
menu for button channel volume we should also be enough for easy
buy Not faster when they look the same old grey or black the colours
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
larger it's not really on scale then to work an option for mount station
touch options you can't go back
fruity colours And a two colours like reading brown light out dark red deeper read
remote control has no way or in the settings menu to look up some some channels on your television
shapes it is something between the square shape sit around got on the round
options is the settings of the remote enough to tv and that a thing called cults settings
rubber which you can look and feel weird
hard part of this or softer rubber is the best suits poll up material
big difference between young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
tie That what you'd like to do on the screen is want to go back
young people they liked fruity colours Innovative all the colleges you blue red yellow
graphical user interface are also some questions about the concepts you have some ideas
easy to have it something like but and minus here the sofa here Minus
navigate through menu great with the scroll
chip on print think cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
men about future of next to each other on a normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip
simple
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium
point we already decided that on the previous meeting placed inside our project folder
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
find something in the middle ground that square and round corners put a little in the middle
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
noticed that be in this file design and user interface there are going to work together on for a foundering a smartboard
sense that it you ask you give a question mark how much we spy thing with energy
time we have forty minutes or thirty minutes of forty minutes of use Nx
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
show some points on which we it should take a decision
record into the device into the speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
recharge through docking station
Volume selection
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
agenda the base five presentation is once again or at least an agenda
lay flat down on table
edit issue to remove degrees
bike little rr and r and rr on the top
