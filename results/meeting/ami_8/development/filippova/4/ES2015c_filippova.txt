back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control
flexible design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
simple would go with the push button
links into the different depends on what type of buttons we have an input
back so i had so many buttons on and the shape was so some that's that are be pressing like a volume but instead of that one button
choice of buttons what functions will show
important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be technologically innovative
actual remote would be hard plastic and put it in rubber can get on top
meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design
design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
decided that the command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
stick graphical user you must need some presentation for the graphics like an lcd
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television that people have in the kitchen
audio because we how other televisions work
buttons so one same colour it's face could have its own colour of button
User interface design so those are the trendy and we still have the money
phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons
kinetic thing was stressed about lies it's instant energy is transformed into a power
end so more internal casing and the rubber coating which is on the case
mind more design an hour more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons
numbers of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power
advanced would have to go with a lcd c display
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates in this meeting
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
Screen settings was use zero point five elements on a scale of ten that's brightness
work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job
Pop in tarot will have to work off of them see how fashion to change
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house cat our dog
difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
work with rubber has already given the market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
rubber that's used and stress balls and things that says rei not so stressful
decision is chip that we going to meet so it's a medium or regular
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
including the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip
circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
titanium is not to be possible in know it just to be on top budget
source is not necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
due to the fruit and vegetables is the only Area that i find rather jarring
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual components so we'd have to get it in separately
Display anyway you that will probably won't have to focus so much not be more than the numbers
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentations
cutting edge technology wise kinetic
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty
dynamo which is the thing that was used to which is fifty years here real
keyboard so the numbers are like a keyboard you pressing
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
reconvene in thirty minutes it back
shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real swimming or a store
amount of time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user
stick to tv based maybe tv in the dark
problem with international a appeal if we have audio
personal coach will be the best of the information We need to start making some more specific decisions
shorter report
impact if it's got to something as they wouldn't damage just it's not so easy
