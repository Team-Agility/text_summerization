present this presentation that is what we want the remote control
ready Betty often because they lost the remote comes in the remote control the remote
people go through by as a remote control when they broke brought to hold
remote control Being one or beyond thing and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition
perfect remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
time corporate to do with the remote control you start and then you stop
difference Between the them the first know control or is this something for a reminder of televisions
remote market or what so the remote or because the cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
remote control but i have new you we inputs for about that the peaks
pretty wide range of remote controls on ep means talk on which is a customer know written review side
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
possibility is to download programme information into the lcd screen
younger people are they are more interested they incorporating new technologies for young peoples
simplest thing the remote control does is it just change that change the channel
point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty five you're price
application and then shape of the buttons is important but also it the number of buttons
prototypes for right and left handed people are what it about the shape of the remote control
point to To find out can we increases the price part of this right control
speech recognition technology switch at existing so deeply the book would be which is the easiest
work it does work was supposed to work on and so on the working
showing now how easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
People so complain because they all have the same size of the voters four buttons which are not betty
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen just for changing channel
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition to adjust and that can fit
tv or we have control of the tv that we can work with and grab information
size buttons but what each of those buttons does something different in a different context
wise limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition if you can leave it sitting there on that Remote
feeling is that it's Rick regarding costs digits we have and target price it's not possible to goals two lcd
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
programmes on off and you what channels already what's on If you have a list
working design is so user interface could be of two things one is the usual
users as our marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition
problem means then the user has to understand each of that functionality
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared of lcd and speech record
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press a button
option since this is pressed to be kinda fashionable device is there's a certain factor that you can you can have with technology
buttons normal requirements like a big courting all those things are required and for wise
cd screen except for the really main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons
zine time for me to to bring you to some new way you informations
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should feed the hand shape
internet connectivity would be to have this program driven interface rather than the channel number
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
scroll was actually pretty comfortable if you want to get this and on top
teletext but we want to get read one of four requirements you need that internet
speak buttons out of something which is really everybody's ready in good morning
hope that next meeting we do that we take some decisions that they record sex
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
scd e still on this get used to open to discussion next meeting you have the task you have to work
brings us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet aspects because you see the text is outdated
find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
opinion there My and all these mine though shouldn't be bit smaller
master a very easy is assigned they could be sold in inside the court
sounds in english to send funny and spanish name work especially if we're selling
optional extra did gonna make our product since we say we put in the fashion in electronics
message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting similarly there are different interfaces
cda same movement which is not with our not very up repeat device You'll do we have problems
naming we see fault for the look-and-feel later so let's go for this representation
final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
