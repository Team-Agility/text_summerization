double curved then you can that's you can only use the rubber buttons
possibility for us to use scroll scroll wheels because it's all curved
personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control concepts
watching a movie and you haven't move the remote a remote control
scroll wheels that's the speaker the speech recognition the rubber The fancy colours
scroll is work with one one curved case
note if you want to use these rubber double curved get a case
case of the volume button is on the side but do you touch
spongy feel you need to to make it buttons all of rubber
flawless Think about a scenario where you would use the scroll button
colouring is important and soft materials
implemented with the regular chips we can still control advanced functions the chip
remote controls are high-tech and just or weird Shape So i suggest
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
market would like something titanium casing
Integrating a scroll bar on this side
fruit you have to colours We have to simple design and it's too dull
banana a telephone telephone from siemens the yellow rubber telephone it's a rubber
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
uncurved or flat case that's the most common remote can control form
voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
older group a step further dark colours simple shapes from the material
yellow
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular an advanced chip
feel lie if you feel your remote control you just rub on the cover so you're up on the painting
buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch
fruit and vegetables In their clothes shoes but they are a remote controls
voice recognition you say i were you can program words like volume
feel of the material has to be spongy
sample sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip i fault
points i would like to some issues that would like to point
material but we're since we're cost reading room The younger group likes a more colourful
yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours
cell phones which exchangeable cover with the rubber finishing
chosen the more battery with solar cells as energy source which brings
kinetic thing it is it's possibility is more sense of it and you can store
tv when you have to make some energy kinetic energy and all the wise
escape skip the lcd displays there's no way you can integrated scroll wheels
curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
Ease of use it is important findings are innovation is more important
issue i addressed at the beginning of the meeting the voice function we with the infrared issue
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar panel and hand dynamo
phase source and is the design of the look and feel The user interface design
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
space in our finance i would say do integrated
bet i understood that the market is decide as a little older
lcd display really need the advanced a version which is a bill
piece of this action with which you believe it is you use a mute
imagine it's very goal to talk to a device with you have two points to another device
devices like at telephones and are radio pocket radios
personal coach will give you more information
watch in a display or which channel you have chosen like that often the amount of volume
watch you watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of energy then the shaking
walls the reef like the infrared light
forty minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
manufacturing department is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion
afraid is not possible to print a picture or the size
