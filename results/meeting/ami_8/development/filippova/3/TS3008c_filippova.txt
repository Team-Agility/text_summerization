watchers but remote control for double functions maybe buttons like that and to control that's lcd
affect a grew up in in buying remote controls maybe can bring
spongy material is very irritating for the remote control
speaker in the remote control and you want to retrieve it and the base
banana is it's it's not easy for remote control
fruits and vegetables it has to be colourful

case you must use or rubber the buttons to that the rubber
components of remote control the case the properties of material we have to choose
lcd screen and it's very special a very trendy to have a remote control
colours are you are many colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
material it was a good idea to use the plastic in tears would softer rubber
idea is that a good idea we have already mentioned all arguments
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station
design already resemble what i already said a specific piece of fruit
basic buttons to skip channels
buttons and it should and the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
possibility i i looked upon was the lcd display fits in that emission
simple design which sturdy
top and when you have a table for more than two weeks she just gets annoying because it still be too flashy
thousand and four you can't put something on the market really likes
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people dark
idea of maybe at that came kind type of body weight and then with plastic colouration rounded
functional to indicate which what a device you are controlling test
bring one line with the dark colour
start with the technical things we have to discuss
pictures of fruit and vegetables And spongy material I found this image
email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility to put a scroll button
breaks it's not very solid two and the material is soft rubber
big team of artists
decided to use only basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
material and then you're gonna have like to material lines
plastic and a soft things and titanium Would also be a bit weird
part of it and then you get a very large lcd screen
fruity thing is just the shape should be for today this is fruit just round curves
logo our base station is also off the shelf all the materials
design experts we will work that half
tvs have an a menu nowadays to access the screen settings
time you would have teletext and the menu
sell will need to bring out line of tvs which we were planning
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease
tv guide only for the channel with that we were for programs
back began a resolution with it the goal is backs and colours
spongy thing already comes for in the in the cushions pets and things on this side
save a perhaps a some tiny buttons aren't user-friendly then we wouldn't can implement
easy for you to read the minutes in you can find them in the proper
pretty cheap design to see if they within our limits of twenty five euros
easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple
tv has to send information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
base things we'll read discuss the know fees
fruit is a yellow and black and white that's on the old grey
chip the chipset and the board it'll off the shelf also the speaker
yellow real young men and then make styles
nineties maybe what we're up to write from to this point and that's why i like the dark called our corporate
problem lights we have to incorporate slides
Sports and gaming what you find a balance
produce multiple multiple
emission know it's like more phone row ball and it adds
switch from softer works it's also too much to the lawn wanna spend
