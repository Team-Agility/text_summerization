present this presentation that is what we want the remote control
importance and they're in the remote comes in the remote control the remote
people as see a remote control when they broke brought to hold
remote control Being one or beyond thing and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition
perfect remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
time corporate to do with the remote control it you get lost
simple a task in that we're only doing a television remote control
remote market or what so the remote or because the cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
control but i have new you we inputs for about that the peaks
pretty wide range of remote controls on ep means talk on which is a customer know written review side
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
possibility is to download programme information into the lcd screen
younger people are they are more interested they incorporating new technologies for young peoples
simplest thing the remote control does is it just change that change the channel
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
application and then shape of the buttons like say the number of buttons
list people are what it about the shape of the remote control
find out can we increases the price part of this right control
speech recognition technology switch at existing so deeply the book would be which is the easiest
work it does work was supposed to work on and so on the working
showing now how easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
People so complain because they all have the same size of the voters four buttons which are not betty
list of programmed an lcd screen just for changing channel numbers easily
discussing about the speech recognition gets in the way more than that helps
tv or we have control of the tv then we can actually display
groups or you could even have some buttons like on the sides
speech recognition if you can leave it sitting there on that Remote
feeling is that it's Rick regarding costs digits we have and target price it's not possible to goals two lcd
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
programmes on off and you what channels already what's on If you have a list
working design is so user interface could be off more than one type
marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition
problem means then the user has to understand each of that functionality
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared of lcd and speech record
press the press the button to talk and the tvt v set
option since this is pressed to be kinda fashionable device is there's a certain factor that you can you can have with technology
requirements like a big courting all those things are required and for wise
cd screen except for the really main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons
time for me to to bring you to some new way you informations
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
design should feed the hand shape and it should not be really small
internet connectivity would be to have this program driven interface rather than the channel number
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
scroll was actually pretty a pretty penny way of change the channel
requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
speak buttons out of something which is really everybody's ready in good morning
hope that next meeting we do that we take some decisions that they record sex
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
scd e still on this get used to open to discussion next meeting you have the task you have to work
brings us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet capability
find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
opinion there My and all these mine though shouldn't be bit smaller
master a very easy is assigned they could be sold in inside the court
sounds in english to send funny and spanish name work especially if we're selling
forces you had a company which is putting the fashion in electronics
message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting similarly there are different interfaces
cda same movement which is not with our not very up repeat device
naming we see fault for the look-and-feel later so let's go for this representation
final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
