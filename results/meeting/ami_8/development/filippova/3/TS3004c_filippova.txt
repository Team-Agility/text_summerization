shape than a normal remote control
ordinary remote controls as good morning remote control the control about changeable
document be sent to the station of the remote control and the recharger
curved remote controls we must use rubber buttons like text easy to put that on the button
basic buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons
pretty standard these rubber buttons are wish there should be on top
smaller remote control you can cd or you have to but you reach both both sides
current controllers are all black and plastic it's that our problem
switch channel up button above the numbers and switch channel down button
back that you'll get the button you knew a lot more like the that meant that and they three player
difference if you put this this switch channels on side of it on top
volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake
fancy because of the lights on the bottom that's what difference
modern remote controls the buttons are part so focuses on these two parts
green colour the backlight
important aspect is that you must make it fancy and it looks original
numbers should be in the bottom and the switch channel in the middle
main point is still is that i've no not a technological innovative
cheap and it's easy to know me for a push to the yup
difference is that we use a scroll wheel will still the plo
buttons normal rubber like normal ordinary buttons soft
basic care colour fronts
blinking light on my phone and change the colour
integrated in the chip so if we use speech recognition
drop it you wanna change the volume only if you use your finger
deciding yellow and it did the top and black and yellow the world
sense if you put it somewhere in the chances the beautiful scroll
decided that we don't to make use of a lcd or speech recognition
recognition We i don't think we should put it on top band
expensive chip We need if we doing if we're doing a display
colours blue red and green blue red so Flashy kinda colours the shape
chip can be a simple a regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced
divide you have to round it on the button and of skip
de curved is like front to the back and three d curves
original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod And and three players mobile phones
room no just battery context like normal batteries just a rechargeable batteries expense
slide in the docking station
display requires an advanced chip
shape should be curved So round shapes not nothing square
strange that i receive information about the cost but just a about the chip
see-through one in a fruit front so we put on the market
personal thing is that we should go more modern look and d player
product you by your get one and more basic or you can choose
low if we will a lot of room to put in as logo
show you the And i the the menu to that what's it called
User interface
kinetic a like but the polls watch so it operates
design so i did some searching on the internet
people that want to spend money on something that's similar to a cheaper
zapping is the highest priority
target group we talk about was young and trendy
stands for a new technical features and then that this is a point of discussion
small electronic units will give a standard answer of should recognise the question sample sensor sample

mother into like this area up so the focus
looked at some similar devices and my own common knowledge
ergonomic fits in hand
sports and gaming to vines style two or three sticks
clothes shoes the ta
