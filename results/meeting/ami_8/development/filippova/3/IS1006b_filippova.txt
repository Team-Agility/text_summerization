control so you wouldn't have to that type in your buttons in these remote controls
suggest is that instead of deciding also for what could be and what should be a good the remote control that's ask people who are users of remote controls
people are very frustrated with their remote controls do you mean that makes sense
functions that made be use but you do use or in the Current remote controls
focusing on tv but you that we talk about the universe so the remote control
feel about to the crack remote control now some more some of those it's just a remote control
targeting the what who are we targeting with these remote control because it's targeted
remote control and as we can see it really does a dh young people
menu which can be controlled with the left right up down and cover
buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that are only a couple of people that want to have a power button
control suppose you said that you set up some volume and any move
controls or we can have more functions for tv or vcr or dvd player et cetera
control he for targeting young people this is something do you read
survey on the use of the remote controls and i'd like to show
function easy it is being could be instead off using the buttons it's on top
main chip which controls or volume and these buttons and this tsb's
control we would have each one and that was our own personal settings
phones some of the phones have some of these so functionality phone that you can phone your phone
simplest one as long as they are the i find the buttons should be easy to find a good button
source which sends the information to the main device
easy to go just next we have hundreds of channels
encryption that it's pricing information but it tv device
focusing on all work and a place to waste actual remote control
portable device which will send messages to the main head and device
aim at a young people read do we like to see zap
buttons we need is on off volume or a tree be something like volume
interaction like so was people do that so like to turn on with clapping
ds to hide the device and they all the early adopters of the new device our young people
case between one and then the relevant it seems that people find teletext they're relevant
dui d you mark will be focused on the user interface concept
technical functions but more user interface and kinda intentions and I was an adjustment
people really need to go to channel number twenty five and ten to sixty
leaving you can find him and the simple by the device like any more bulb and you can have this voice their lives
scenes or User interface In to sustain speech recognition in a remote control
voice like it can turn on the lights For you just to find it as a light
project manager Ask me to do some presentation about technical functions design
propose this concept for a design just few buttons the screen was the backlight which can change colours
components maybe the energy source
warm market expert some again show up on that trend watching
simple speech recogniser then or generally smaller reduce the signal crossing cheap
move out you move to the other car All the room and take a control
mysterious these key buttons can be transformed into some miss a day
control so we should pretty spend lots of time doing this presentation
feel what's like paul or switch on or some lake
focused on the Individual actions but not on the components we can incorporate
big and reportedly sends some information to be She played in some form like more lemon trees or like this keating
generally in the form of infrared or Some just sense of information
tvs will have different encryption court for blinks research on a chain
wonderful feel for seen those from the technical part
keys are increase or we played only recognised or sports
distance and the angle maybe if you have a six euros fifty
automatic on off is also a big problem idea
back before a specific instruction what was saying to you by your personal coach
miss a day and then you to process but be cheap and they need to generate
remember what is there a site It's for kids the tvt stress injury
compare with these ones that this corner one or two rubber
display on numbers and then they can display is supposed to fly d displays born
end to know the new project's requirement
buy a line width
normal battery so this battery one ceases to see jonah it to tape
