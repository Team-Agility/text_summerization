back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control
flexible design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
simple would go with the push button
research team of phones and in new multiple all options scroll buttons
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
choice of buttons what functions will show
important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be easy
discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic and the casing is rubber
meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design
design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
stick graphical user you must need some presentation for the graphics like an lcd
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television that people have in the kitchen
audio because we how other televisions work
buttons so one same colour it's face could have its own colour of button
interface to make it more trendy and we still have the money
phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons
fully kinetic thing was stressed about lies it's instant energy source idea
end so more internal casing and the rubber coating which is on the case
mind more design an hour more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons
numbers of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power
advanced would have to go with a lcd c display
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates in this meeting
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
Screen settings was use zero point device a mice for for a control
work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job
Pop in tarot will have to work off of them see how fashion to change
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house cat our dog
difficult if it's a rubber plate going on top or would stay
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
work with rubber has already given the market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
rubber would just be that what's in contact with the human eye
decision is chip that we going to meet so it's a medium or regular
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
including the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip
circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
titanium is not to be possible in know it just to be on top budget
source is not necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
due to the fruit and vegetables is the only Area that i find rather jarring
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television set
simplified Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
lost my powerpoint i can't remember what it's got at the components
cutting edge technology wise kinetic
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty
dynamo which is the thing that was used to which is fifty years here real
keyboard so the numbers are like a keyboard you pressing
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
reconvene in thirty minutes it back
shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real swimming or a store
time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user
stick to tv based maybe tv in the dark
problem with international a appeal if we have audio
personal coach will be the best of the information We need to start making some more specific decisions
shorter report
impact if it's got to something as they wouldn't damage just it's not so easy
