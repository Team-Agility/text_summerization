remote control was you all the time
remote controls and speech recognition
remote control we should be easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone
finally it has to be useful as a remote control is pink
profit remote control with a lot of buttons
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
general people change tv more often than batteries on their remote control
market of remote controls they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention
simple button and speech recognition technology we take at least five euros or that you put some control we want to reduce
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
device on that can be used for speech recognition you want the radios
marriage are all The Brawl the way of saying the thing if we look back
converse to having you see the button i the weirdest maybe one of these buttons
people use need to the trains if we were in the world as our company
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and batteries
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser
chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive compared to lcd
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology inside
hate those specific features or they really like They're more want these fancy features
back light kills a lcd screen was different colours
rubber aspect might be important
recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology
concept of the interface we used and if there is some supplements
flat different colours Depending on what is around like what colours around and depending on the temperature
chip do we have only the plastic or that cd five or A chip
important because it's what is pretty more feasible in terms of sponginess
follow smart should be some not too complicated
lighting we have many options in the market
problem is that this design we phone that we can't use the double record shapes
ready pretty to pay
technology and so that we can have Enough space or enough money
shape it has to be more wrong than the More roo look natural
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a i'll put that says creaky what they are actions
important to be fancy have to have a fancy look-and-feel and then interestingly
propose but the use of solar cells hand too late to just use simple battery
friends you can travel from golf to furniture so it might be fruit and vegetable
selling point maybe it has to be the base
ready in the post and down to locate then we have to go for some speaker
blue You use maybe for the addendum Nobody's expense
story that for the point before why not the rubber is expensive
plastic we stick last time
big and there's so i'm just asking them the current trends according to them when the going to store is that when they asked there are friends
component to use for energy and the media and the interface for energy
fruit these teams can be easily incorporate
interface there to use pushbuttons or you could just read it cd display
phone we can use the phone as a good to Example of work to it beeps back
watching the trends there inventing it You're creating the trend i hope
meeting
record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that mark and then sandy
end we find out that it's not feasible
straight on these individual action g which are for them ram out a bit design
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
red goes faster than the life
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
work together a menu on a prototype using modelling clay
body one call really come up with our forties
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning
puts lots of concentrate
