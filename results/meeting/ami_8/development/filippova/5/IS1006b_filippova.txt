aim at a young people read do we like to see zap
buttons we need is on off volume up or like to do might take a remote control do that sounds
interaction like so was people do that so like to turn on with clapping

project manager Ask me to do some presentation about technical functions and put it in somebody's data format
propose this concept for a design just few buttons the screen was the backlight which can change colours
components maybe the energy source
warm market expert some again show up on that trend watching
