hundred a new remote control is quite subjective experience
remember that remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote control
talk about the technical functions design objectives
energy going to the user interfaces controlling the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared
personally what i want from a remote control what we want to do it sends a message
focusing on the designers people specifically said that it's not remotes were ugly seventy
people are only using ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote
technical functions presentation working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
lots of buttons and the relevant the polls buttons could be yellow but we can play
button them i'm gonna buy a new remote all they want like an upgrade
sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls
industrial design if you're components concept user interface the user interface concept market trend were watching
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people
people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people
big buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the volume changing the channel
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicated
combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
older people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition
pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
type in the page number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
crap remote taking with their tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
brings energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip transmitting information
breaks i was given in terms of each was the voice recognition was inverse be related to age
mentioned things like voice recognition but at the price
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
wind One large accessible buttons for the essential
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
frustrations are any issues that come up in your e in new or a summary
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find a way of striking a balance
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that just received
hides all the complicated buttons
imagine just it is an electronic device that allows us to do certain effects on the television
button on the television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
talk about our functions and our target group that means that is very few we need to each group
economic we need to find a balance between features and price as you mentioned
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of an lcd screen was brought
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest frustration
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
receiver and in my opinion infrared
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings adjust brightness
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes left to define our functions
battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
price limit of the twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
coffee at the end you just only when really going on or even that those things can go out and you're happy
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple
thirty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting on them in the shared folder
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
twenty five euro
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
white or thereabouts draw
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
