points from the remote control
concept to see the however voice control concepts
microphone sitting there is a remote control it you can send these can use remote control
channel control and just a would be controller fancy controller and the fancy control maybe try to mix
support you i'm what do we get into that you if you have of what voice control why not to put it back on the tvs speed add to the tv and not on the remote controller
meet the user requirements i'm just who's sort and then the use of the remote control market
remember as i said last meeting we are really have to be able to fashion remote control
power control to be smart
point is this d wanted it to be technologically innovative
voice recognition then just recognition if you have a remote control that like have an object
find maybe a shape for the wooden wouldn't be wooden remote control it gives order to the tvc
related to what you said was the speech or just to recognition and on just recognition
intelligent control we need something that's easy which an impression a piece and in addition
tv in the darkness so if you want to fine you're fine your remote control of these are lost in the dark
product it is Technology is the for the immediate were really need to the mexican recognition
easy to use it's not so important actually with respect
controller read that cover only a single function if you do not have some function like for browsing
lost the features we can attract a lot of user
combine this with the fashion in general i have checked more than only the remote control
present the concept of user interface would be very cute
functional tv you can retrieve that tv we then you tv be seen that probably function
develop a remote control always speech and gesturing
team Expert told us most of the people want to use the remote control to zap between channels
ranking all for the points fancy look-and-feel is the most important one and then if we combine
price of adding these solar battery would it be something really that will increase the price
tv and just to recognise gestures and voice of the gesture
small tv simple them to read they're all comparable we've anyway if there's no key features
mobile out of you choose the line b s was recognition system will be able to instead of french
time do you think it will work everybody wanting to change channels in the same time
comparable to be easy to use that to be said fifty functions so it's a combination
switching more apart from voice suggest you need to be free without any objects you just want to interacts
user uses the one who gonna buy the product is works matter percent reliable we do replace it with another man
marketing studies asking people to have this them and it can be something interesting to make people buy
Technical as the sun interface designer speak first is to take heed jordan
user of compromise that is also the use of the tv
fit with the wood and design
teed off and kind income for a dv you if you have the control save ten
main point from the trend And fashion
decisions about the components concept about the energy
work more power on the spongy way to add spongy and touch to the buttons
boat and that is the buttons because it's i don't have any in the dark it's fish
complex comments but easy vote to remember it i reckon
innovative and maybe using solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add
features of our corporate site as you have the feature of voice recognition mean mobile but you still don't use it to be a mother
line to hide income for so there are three concepts
year is that every scene from clothes shoes and furniture is easy inspired by fruits and vegetables
country where you live in the countryside you are far from the cds in some place and instantly are so if you have it at least if you have solar a limitation you just when you want to have a recharger or a remote control or you just put it on the side
similar to what i've said in the previous meeting will start in thirty meeting minutes left Spends
Stick to the first part so what's the difference between our comparable with other products in the market
balls like out of wood and in wood
fit on the price you want out of four euros
chip on print so you if you propose lot of all chips would be a and off to have something working
show use the design of what the inside at what the inside and out as a different component
point is you were so we do want to have some very cheap Integrated circuits chips or do we have to lower level or very expensive
war because you don't have to wear a microphone
find maybe we will close the position
specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach
tuition to have on that bus presentation
