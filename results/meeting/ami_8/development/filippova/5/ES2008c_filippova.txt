lots of buttons for the features
cost we should just go for push buttons which is what real reaction
press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
buttons could be shaped like different fruits
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
onscreen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
matter how many buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting
people they blinked on the important aspects of a remote control
summary that was market investigation on remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
important features for a remote is seen a menu display that comes up on the television
main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as or the case you get bored
thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast
buttons for your favourite channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control the television from your armchair
determine what the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
interface and we'll come back to the chip
decided on like a simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip depending
lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main ones being like and lemons or stripe
ri uses for buttons to me to move around so range of settings so on a small lcd screen
time when you're watching tv if you're changing the brightness tuning the tv and the button to switch
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
model is a going to be for user interface list of device
solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
options of using the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display would have to be quite small
essentially we need to choose how is this device this is an ipod from apple
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case it can have any titanium
main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time i am imagining
type of battery you find in porches from about fifty years ago flashlights
number of different choices for a design concept and start
switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
essential properties of the user interface we have to decide on whether i have a scroll
examine each element separately but we're designing
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
specific functions to keep the remote from getting lost a large buttons for the essential functions a possibility for extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
find a way to protect like the chip
changeable covers like for your mobile in different fruit and vegetable or like i don't like a carrot source
minutes from the functional design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on how should report are produced
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
hit my understanding of old latex cases that it's hard to protect inside but it's covered
point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options that we have for manufacturing
attend a certain amount of space
presentation i have one more slide before we close but in that side
saved it this in the shared project
