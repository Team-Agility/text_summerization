easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
list of what functions are are going to to be on the screen and that and it screen menu
normal functions the basic functions you normally press
menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
Channel up and down and the control of the advanced options and functions and buttons is easy
zapping which are a remote control you can press the menu button and then you are certainly into the the display
people use mobile phones and also have a screen is on top which function
users if we put led lights on the buttons so that if you press on the menu button
design of the bus buttons for a for all the channels you can just push one button
press said you the screen gets activated and then you can use this buttons to press
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional requirements
confirm a want to go one step back it's only two extra buttons
longer so that you can put your from also reach the middle of it says menu
reach a little bit for the power button but that's present channel volume selection are teletext
remote like this if you put it on the top on the side
concentrate more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen
navigate the channels and left or right for the volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons
features the above forty people are not so interests and to not interested in the screen or speech recognition
channel five and phone account channel anything you want to move the only kind to channel program the channels
department do we need just the functional display and for curses
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
serving of one hundred subjects in the usability lab using the remote control options so we need to menus
lower age groups a design it's it doesn't make a remote control on noticed in your room
phones options are activated based on some so for options that's communicate with the infrared decoder
tvs in standby people don't understand it so so they need a simpler remote
problem mean you are you a car and channel and then it just say is which number
younger users are more acquainted with these machines so they can use more advanced functions
save this and you just press the number in a remote and then say a confirm and then it's a it's easier
harder to if you have already program it to swap
idea because then it becomes clear about the extra two buttons or active
information came it was xx with all the steps in the remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
marketing research stated that users are not afraid of a lot of functions or make the buttons as user-friendly
functions and on the Seems was it the target that's a group so it's above forty
prefer we use the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
wary of space left and then put a logo should be like on top
tv options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble on base
microphone it can be very small phones are just are some stripes a little holes
irrelevant the less use for audio settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
clear distinction between age groups concerning the features but we just have to build them in because they find
tvs automatically display the name which you get to the cable
signal of certain spatial frequencies it's a counters one it shows on your tv and so your remote
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television with that usually three buttons and very hard
plug in the power cable when you go back to it to upper level the finally
additional process or and also for part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
overview of what we discussed in our last Meeting
news flash and teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
product should reach a new market which is the customers below forty
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information that i need so frustrating
problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway and lots of the times there is a brand present
skip this price as because i read a ball forty is it from twenty to forty
work for thirty minutes
received an email so i'd like we'll use so i'd just drop it in the folder
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
kinda structure in two layers
figure or figure out a way to do that easily
overrides the previous and previous
called a cold lasts
mit v doesn't have any cue equalising
