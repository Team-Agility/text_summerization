user wants to help control more than one device want to control more than one device from the same remote control
base station even if it's just you press that button on that and and the remote control
find that the shape of a fruit bat that in that aspect of a of the remote control Many many colours remind some visitor
buying an eel control the remote you do need my income for a remote buying
base decision and there is a button there are that are more to start beeping so with the remote control that looks like a banana which few buttons i have to be at some point it has to a circuit board
functionality is just a couple scroll-wheels not button it's hard to get so many buttons on the banana
extent it be a text in the remote control what having an a base station control
speak lost control
face to put their cd on the banana if you could have the colour of a banana
powerful are powered by a man though it's a button on the fruit
easier to do a banana and plastic
starting is good but you could you should have more the shape of banana you wanna of holders may you may be one of the whole like a gun know and you don't have to point toward the fall
scroll button but push technology for channel selection volume control and they need exposing these are the three scroll
difficult to make it steve like the texture of an hour anyway and take to have exact shape
design and you have to work on the user should it should be already p define
cost a lot just feel five watch
morning coffee machine me to recognise that for it and it'll play back good morning how would you like a coffee
folk or not and not that's not the similar to a fruit design the number eight maybe we wanna so what collection of fruit but a different fruit for kids
people would find out what's it even if it wasn't a recharging station even if they didn't have to buy batteries that rechargeable batteries so all the period of car find him to cut the cost
worth but it doesn't really add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech recognition engines
genetically engineered for it is designed to be square so they'd attack start it in the boxes
telephone handset is there and the base station is nothing more just it's that by which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket
unique problem with television's is that if you have this got this scroll-wheel for the television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll
wall or a sporting keywords but everybody's and saying it's volume and channel we also want one for the volume is it's it's very handy for it to have the instant feedback and response
sell this is a very if it's gonna be a banana as a pretty gimmicky Think that doesn't have that much functionality could be used for pressing the mobile phone which has been misplaced
received an email i'll and lunchtime they know that the bring in mind to the technology division has developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit
rising is a factor for us that so we'll go for the regular chip supports speaker support so this functionality
basis a extra things to support additional devices like bci dvd players which are usually a touch with the tv
decided not to go for speech recognition technology just because of some reasons and all honesty
issues so where we place this chip then if it's too far away from a the casing was the casing is too thick then you may not hear the speaker from the outside of the banana
beep or people are more the devastating never find a fancy look and feel down in the technology gonna be know in innovation
spend but charge idea of a banana but without looking completely pointless For the in the fall from the interaction
feel so old now More more core aspect not more hard core that aspect rather than a devise ways to many phones times on many buttons
real recognise i he was but he was in a set not like a freight you train
advanced technology lcd has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out so it's the basic
plastic as a thing is that most appropriate one it'll ring the cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production components
convex can be concave depending on what people or nineteen ninety five percent of young people are worse
pushbuttons the traditional users so that they don't feel the and i needed list
recognise it can be like a match on on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back the phrase in response
theoretical usability committee point without worrying too much about how to develop
combination just to train it's not the law and channel four hundred channels you have to be a tool to recognise
card application i would presume that it's they wouldn't design of the hand a hundred
clarify this these questions that they had in the meeting we should take a decision on that point
car and The car and train which was for the functional look and feel
work to do was to go to move forward
break so you'd have to worry too much about the case the chip a lot is going to be sitting inside you could have you can still have some cushioning that's not visible to the user
city's would not be possible to implement it for the next prototype is but actually integrated
additional it will be might be having slightly better market
hold a cap sit
default be forced the findings a meeting i like to draw some sketch about so which would be the pro the final product and that were strip
target a very high means fifty million euros is that profit
ripple it's all the ideas we've had we had doing these presentations just to draw some sketch
top of that we can have solar cells
cells and the lighting conditions are good that can be useful it'd be pretty in a week
plastic you can have the book but the side not the materials like wood that's got a grinding you put some of an agenda
shape if you'd and not be out the door probably you may as do it in a style as way that just looks a bit more twenty first century route and sixties and seventies
missing israeli fancy and fun and if you teach works we go for the range
set it that's a switch with the double curve would actually menu and you could like drawer something on on the whiteboard
microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big deal
net at economic and oranges
