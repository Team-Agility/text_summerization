pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
structure some of the components is that are used a from what other remote controls
blc d screen if you make screen for called as matter
miss possible to the g you just put in a row underneath it on the bottom of the remote
main you can fit the lcd screen just use and all sex or another as cleaning consulting
decided to have to remotes to the size
changing colours will be easier to do in colour than a shape
hand there and then you want touch the screen
japanese people all time boring
button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons won't get that small when a cds green
meets more the young people can see it because it is the unique
elderly people just plain old because we decided
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly people
chip on print what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button on the bottom of standbys
spots but also possible to create fancy colours wood rubber that's or a that's used to make the case is the same colour
option to use as a in a rather simple chip
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
menu for button channel volume we should also be enough for easy
buy Not faster when they look the same old grey or black the colours
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
large a button or if you have several options appearing on the screen the colour nations
touch options you can't go back
fruity colours which you are be seen in the autumn like them would say the dark brown or red and brown
remote control has no way or in the settings menu to look up some some channels on your television use is called a scroll down on a menu which probably does not fit on a screen
shapes like a week you said is that's easy better or for the elderly people something like that Like the ipod do something with the round shapes
options is the settings of the remote enough to tv and that a thing called cults settings
rubber which you can look and feel weird
round shapes As soft with the materials like the rubber is the best suits poll up material
big difference between young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
morning or a coffee maker and it says that says do you back good morning joe or which made this and this the easy
personal preferences for the young peoples like a fruity colours Innovative all the colleges you blue red white yellow
graphical user interface are also some questions about the concepts you have some ideas
easy to have it something like but and minus here the sofa here Minus
navigate through menu great with the scroll
chip on print think cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
colour titanium or you have to pay chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip
simple sepia where the synch
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard materials like wood the titanium
point we already decided that on the previous meeting placed inside our project folder
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
soft but if you should the feelings spongy use of sponge bob like face
find something in the middle ground that square and round corners put a little in the middle
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
schools it is in the actual design and user interface there are going to work together on for a foundering a smartboard
sense that it you ask you give a question mark how much we spy thing with energy
meeting is once again in thirty minutes or thirty minutes of forty minutes of use Nx
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
show some points on which we it should take a decision
record into the device into the speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
recharge through docking station
Volume selection
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
agenda the base five presentation is once again or at least an agenda
lay flat down on table
edit issue to remove degrees
bike little rr and r and rr on the top
