shape than a normal remote control
ordinary remote controls amusement remotes more controls as good morning remote control
document be sent to the station of the remote control and the recharger
curved remote controls we must use rubber buttons like text easy to put that on the button
basic buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons
pretty standard these rubber buttons we don't use some in the bottom
smaller remote control you can cd or you have to but you reach both both sides
current controllers are all black and plastic it's that our problem
volume channel to choose channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons
Light switches on if you use a button you knew a lot more like the that meant that and they three player
difference if you put this this switch channels on side of it on top
volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake
fancy because of the lights on the bottom that's what difference
modern remote controls the buttons are part so focuses on these two parts
green colour the backlight
important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel instead of the current functional look-and-feel so it's very important
numbers should be in the bottom and the switch channel in the middle
important aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative big door
spec to the remote control should be easy to know me for a push to the yup
difference is that we use a scroll wheel will still the plo
buttons normal rubber like normal ordinary buttons soft
basic care colour fronts
blinking light on my phone and change the colour
integrated in the chip so if we use speech recognition
drop it you wanna change the volume and top down is more with the channel changing
fronts in red and yellow and it did the top and black and yellow the world
sense if you put it somewhere in the chances the beautiful scroll
telephone also have a lcd or speech recognition you need some way many more buttons
recognition We i don't think we should put it on top band that if we gonna put in more technology eugene need to be able to switch to open
expensive chip We need if we doing if we're doing a display
man a young public you should use materials or soft with primary colours like green blue red so Flashy kinda colours the shape
chip can be a simple a regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced
divide you have to round it on the button and of skip
de curved is like front to the back and three d curves
original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod And and three players mobile phones
room no just battery context like normal batteries just a rechargeable batteries expense
slide in the docking station
display requires an advanced chip
shape should be curved So round shapes not nothing square
strange that i receive information about the cost but just a about the chip
see-through one in a fruit front so we put on the market
personal thing is that we should go more modern look and d player
date display in the ipod a compared to the basic or you can choose one if you buy the project
low if we will a lot of room to put in as logo
show you the And i the the menu to that what's it called scroll-wheel make it in yellow just like the colours of real reaction
sense for an original look and feel of the case and interface
kinetic a like but the polls watch so it operates
design so i did some searching on the internet
usability is very important people that want to spend money on something that's similar to a cheaper
zapping is the highest priority
target group we talk about was young and trendy
stands for a new technical features and then that this is a point of discussion
developed a new speech recognition feature integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit is a very small electronic units will give a standard answer of should recognise the question
case transparent on the wise the backlight one work together on a prototype drawing a smartboard
tad next aspect also in contrast to last year the feel of material suspect it is expected to be spongy
mother into like this area up so the focus
looked at some similar devices and my own common knowledge
ergonomic fits in hand
sports and gaming to vines style two or three sticks
