present this presentation that is what we want the remote control
importance and they're in the remote comes in the remote control the remote
people as see a remote control what's new technology is the people are we gonna have what i was internet connection
finally the incorporation all far as cd or a speech recognition see stand in the remote control Being one or beyond thing and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech
extra internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
time corporate to do with the remote control it you get lost
focusing on tv but still like a universal remote in that as a replacement remote control or is this something for a reminder of televisions
feed the targets in front of cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote controls are used by more than one person's And as you targeting single people
remote controls have been have remain the same for the last five ten years
search for which the top rated the remote controls on ep means talk on which is a customer know written review side
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
possibility is to download programme information into the lcd screen
bring new technologies for young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
channel than a one i what i use a remote control does is it just change that change the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
application and then shape of the buttons like say the number buttons
list people are what it about the shape of the remote control
point to To find it with missus and they improvements we could do to the car and remote controls
top of the could be a speech recognition technology does mean sitting on the remote
industrial designer should work was supposed to work on and so on the working on television remote that was universal is that they have a lcd screens
showing now how easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
People so complain because they all have the same size of the voters four buttons which are not betty
list of programmed an lcd screen you just scroll for that program rubber band to a channel
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition to adjust and that can fit
shame because even with you i don't you could even get teletext information from the tv on to the remote control especially if we don't control the tv or ccd so what systems that exist
groups or you could even have some buttons but what each of those buttons does something different in a different context
speech recognition system as a wide and really quite a microphone also to be sitting there on that Remote
feeling is that it's Rick regarding costs digits we have and target price it's not possible to goals two lcd
twenty five euro because for twenty five euro we can really do with that but the very basic remote control for twenty five euros eddie hattie
programmes on off and you what channels already what's on If you have a list
working design is so user interface could be off more than one type
users as our marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition
problem means then the user has to understand each of that functionality
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared of lcd and speech record
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press a button to talk and the tvt v set
option since this is pressed to be kinda fashionable device is there's a certain factor that you can you can have with technology
requirements like a big courting all those things are required and for wise
screens which helps when you using multiple devices i suppose because you can have multiple functions which have a couple of the round buttons down to a minimum but not quite that interfere with the functionality of the device
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons which there so that the user fee that's that he's smiling doing some he's going aboard the technology
programme you could have a start time to start time all the programs
task say you have like a little not a little gonna base unit they can also receive signals of wills the television where you can say change the lighting in the room
hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should feed the hand shape
internet connectivity would be to have this program driven interface rather than the channel number
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
mobile phones are you don't use you don't remember people's fun be you remember the name and you're fine and then so this would be pretty a pretty penny way of change the channel
lcd you need more requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
speak buttons out of something which is really everybody's ready in good morning
blind about what i what the prepared for this meeting we do that we take some decisions that they record sex
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
scd e still on this get used to open to discussion next meeting you have the task you have to work
brings us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet aspects because you see the text is outdated
find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
opinion there My and all these mine though shouldn't be bit smaller
master a very easy is assigned they could be sold in inside the court
sounds in english to send funny and spanish name work especially if we're selling
optional extra did gonna make our product since we say we put in the fashion in electronics
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting similarly there are different interfaces
cda same movement which is not with our not very up repeat device in use a potentially you can then do a look like change the lights and i close the windows what about the heating
names that we could decide fall just to get something fun for our project we should we could discuss quickly Any ideas
final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
