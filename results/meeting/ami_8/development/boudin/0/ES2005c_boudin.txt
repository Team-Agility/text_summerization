buttons would do we stay different shapes of buttons
big banana shaped remote control and casings of different shapes different fruit
cheap remote this remote control should be a technologically
shit this clearly indicates that preference for the design the outlook of the remote control there is some inconsistency already nick existing in between remote controls is graphical interface
remote control market so we found that people will people do have preference for a those fancy more one of the remote control switch look and feel a vote
people want like if somebody wanted in banana shaped we will put that case we want to that war waveform
chip more lights everything we just design keyrings fruit shape
survey findings was that they want to easy to use a i'm not about the lcd
banana shape they will just make it mixed and matched type shape
buttons do we want to just have a device that maybe sets and pretend it's a fruit
market survey we have seen that people have to like in the cell is out of the time
signals from the buttons in translates into the sequence of courses that it then sends the amplifier
idea because people use mile mice mouse is now with the scrolling
include either with the rid of it some remotes and we give something new technology got are the ones where and as as new design it fancy outlook we really need the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market
people have a later date clothes shoes and furniture everything that fruit and veggie day was causing
nap but if we were designed that even put we report apple-shaped casing on that you do your apple-shaped
factor of this vector is the most important factor
buttons option on one side you get the fashion on the other side with the microphones so you can place it face time
pictures of some a new remote controls to show you that press
interface the buttons and you point to it rather than having the output is a stream of text
specifically as voice activated
setting would actually going for speech thing you said are take now our research and development department saying that they have broken three would certainly speech recognition software that you can programme
lady that fruit and veg a day was to be process is that what they were data
play-doh latex as a kinda spongy feel of the material is expected to be spongy the other than just having a plastic look a hard
pointing out that this one the volume it is pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape
idea but for but and for the thing we tried before easy because there will be on lcd c display in the room a different friend i you can just critical whatever the war
wider for a banana design caving in such a way like half of what we need not to have a full colour we will just have a half of colour
instructions will be sent by your personal coaches
glow in the dark think the strip
chip roster the ta
important aspect in the data to take into consideration is that it should be easy to understand in the local language
double curved send it to me if we're talking about three or can we can easy
specific functions all that in a play stop it got a minute
options from wood or titanium rubber plastic casing and then the buttons and property two different colours
rechargeable battery will be a good idea but then they have to keep them and they are more whites outside the solar energy
easily have the main body blue with the yellow logo and Slogan running up one side
lay that it's got like a little scroll function on the side but i presume that the functions was come up on the tv makers
work on giving me a model in clay
scroll it and then when you reach the a menu item that you require you pressed the middle of a scroll wheel and speech recognition
harm to the environment also because our company is very light up there for taking all this concerns into consideration
casing this email i got from our manufacturing team
doubles as a standard parts and for using it as a recharging of also for using it as send recognition
light run x the more features we had the fancy chips we need to buy input and which adds
discussion over less anybody's got questions The confusions i'm confused
open up there's a circuit board inside it just powers
board we have to use bc at the same setup processor are more pro use a more advanced processor than i had and find transmitter a standard
secure areas and i've seen a lot of them with the cover missing so like other hand like what it is portable phones whatever have that colour lcd screens
sends out the infrared lights signal to the television writers
Mail to use the minutes of the last meeting just to save time
program it like you say you record and then play you and then the court time
preference is just a imagination the race symbols everything but it's pointing

causing the world is not changing use ten plus organic
price and price not withstanding is it too complicated it's it can be too much just overloaded
