watchers but remote control for double functions maybe buttons like that and to control that's lcd
displays remote controls maybe can bring
spongy material is very irritating for the remote control
speaker in the remote control and you want to retrieve it and the base
banana is it's it's not easy for remote control
fruits and vegetables it has to be colourful
bring more designed to market
telling me that when we build a remote control of of plastic or rubber the buttons to that the rubber double curved case is is it a three dimensional curve in the design
components of remote control the case the properties of material we have to choose
lcd screen and it's very special a very trendy to have a remote control
wear off on the five minutes left my know how many colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour look like it the plastic mold is in one colour and thus those cushion pets around it are in another colour set
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
basic idea you got we're probably gonna have like to type of materials like the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights
control if that's a good idea of maybe is a little bit Too much for twelve and a half Abduction
week with the lcd and the docking station we can make our logo
design already resemble some piece of fruit
basic buttons to skip channels
numbers to power button skip the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
mode after the trailers of lcd display on that we do lots of information
simple design which sturdy
top and when you have a table for more than two weeks she just gets annoying because it still be too flashy
remote controls are already on the market likes
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people dark colours simple recognisable shapes
idea of maybe at that came kind type of body weight and then with plastic colouration rounded
functional to indicate which what a device you are controlling test
bring teletext to the tid the result
start off technical part and the material
year are surprisingly fruits and vegetables
email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility for the remote control
buttons has to be solid two and the material is soft rubber for falling and it feels
idea of the plastic and a big team of artists
puts an extra x and on the simplicity of our remotes to make these two most basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
materials you are mentioned in your personal preferences
transfer and plastic is the best with rubber of wood or titanium
sell and then tie a title for programme or at least at a quite large part of the rc The up and the upper part or whatever it's it's not use wood buttons
fruity thing is just the shape should be for today this is fruit just round curves
Drawl really nicely of the best we can put the logo our base station is also off the shelf all the materials
design experts we will work that half
tvs have an a menu nowadays to access the screen settings
time you would have teletext and the menu
reaches a different marked but it doesn't cost really much effort to bring out line of tvs which we were planning
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease
tv channel with that we were for programs
weighing day began a resolution with it the goal is backs and colours
spongy thing already comes for in the in the cushions pets and things on this side
trendy too because that's the mode it it's a it's icsi a extent
part of the minutes are very hard to read because there are two documents that one layer
back to the costs again but we get a bill but pretty cheap design to see if they within our limits of twenty five euros
skip the house as easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple electronic all chip is available with the led transmission or a transmitter
ia is still don't have any information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
mobile phone you can read text
fruit is a yellow and black and white that's on the old grey
chip the chipset and the board it'll off the shelf also the speaker and wireless retriever are all available in our company
real young men and then make styles
point and that's why i like the dark called our corporate
problem lights we have to incorporate slides
Sports and gaming what you find a balance
produce multiple multiple
emission know it's like more phone row ball
coverage when you go to the living room
