add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy for us to implement to change the channel
dec design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
unique feature of a remote control and the advanced remote controls so we might want to build in the future to support them Some audio signal like one phones
important button And there are lots of people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control
power buttons and use one time and the volume
ten percent the buttons
top goal of this meeting is to reach decision on the product on the target group and the functions of the remote control is to send messages to the television set
device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find the remote controls
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
people would bother walking to tv and press that button because they are lost the remote
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set starts to make a weights out and your remote controls
function and the problem to programme button to switch to to channels when you have something and channel four n something on channel six just one button which can jane's
functions and the money that we can say from that we should use for having a design and thinking about the user interface designer
multi function and remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
relevance scale the channel selection you have them to most important or volume selection and the teletext
buttons for the advanced other Functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all functions available device
multi function and can be implemented in in our design or energy save design we should really implement
buttons like that which are easy to use rc is the best one possibility
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet is replacing teletext
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip which just a voice recognition our circuit board will become even more cheap
volume because maybe people do not always want to use the voice
numbers about the speech recognition here that's younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound from other sounds
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
user interface connect to chip which is connected to free things user interface
user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control Because the user in what state
device can have communicate with almost every tv is a bus with nancy
problem is it but it depends on the decisions disease up in this since it's the best and makes about the voice recognition the data
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment that's not a moderate
find a balance between the advanced new techniques and the user friendliness
convinced sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
hebrew i bet devices which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume and the programme one and some fancy lights
buy personally we should infer use infrared
production cost rr in just a part of the equipment
main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger than they have forty which is important
disadvantages that there are so concerns about the costs and things like that battery lifetime energy saving another advantage
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten digits but keep the program
important point is that we really should use energy friendly components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components
career curious to of the market We'll feel about such a product
work i have no time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
younger parts off the market isn't the forty percent to make the five million
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
older you might want to constrain that portion market will Examples will change adapt
Reports or to spend response
dark concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
home station for base station next to see this a little antenna
minutes i make into the shared folder
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
signal from where do you execute the this in south
case we have to metal contacts
