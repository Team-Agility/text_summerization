important still what so what functions there are we want to put in the remote control
simple word that they won't use the remote control they use their own the bit lot more functions
base or we could like make up a button and if you push it the remote i've got some images of remote controls in the world
import because we gonna make such a basic remote control is nothing special it's gonna cost twenty
issue we implement features that of functions we want to implement doesn't really matter
fifty percent says they only use ten percent of the buttons on the remote control very often in the room
functions more buttons maybe it's come becoming less trendy look all the all seven percent of the market is consists of elderly people at who don't really care for trendy look so whatever i it can do no harm to make a trendy for the other thirty percent
open it may be contains some future date you don't normally linked to the remote control i have most of the hour
company already cells remote control to older people claim and to find remote controls and usability lab
elderly you are willing to spend more money on a remote control it's basic remote controls
remote control should only be used for television otherwise the project becomes more complex which endangers time lot of time to market
jump on the couch you pick up the remote and the universe want if you want to keep it simple button and make it they can sturdy
difficult is not a very common function and people like to have such cat and i date
discussion the distinctions in what cut and no that just in functions for other maybe for other quick madonna but just the basic functions it's very important to find
case of this simple remote control the technical problems i have and digitise the last meeting minutes
detailed functions regarding the tv set on your remote controller with two audio settings and a screen settings sound settings which are not very often used We could group them one button And and make them accessible in one menu button
minus button should be quite present
easy market we have to do something special features on it to make it transparent
simple design and no other functions and just if you but taste do aim at the younger format
implement too much features on on our remote control because the elderly people will that last group features for a higher usability lab and they also fill out a questionnaire with a few questions
functions shane it's one when we get a user requirements of the new pretty i was told
start with that technical functions
small market which we will project and if we want to reach customers are within the age group of forty plus new product
tune to skip is the pear we did recharge its own never have the battery that's one fattening
stiff specifically name all the functions over your number
additional requirements for work
opener it is a brilliant idea actually because television and there is not the right combination
lights also around the volume should we do we make them very big buttons flashy design And maybe some cages
show you some of the new project requirements would use is we should focus on the tc
energy it activated chip in the remote it's an electrical circuit Which compose messages in the form of infrared signals to control the television
Relevance options are power buttons are used four hundred and sixty eight times per hour channel selection
time goes by and i never put them in a recharger of thing last one often that put it on site
implement vcr and dvd options group them in the button
out-dated we just want to see what programs are all on and what time supposed to single cost
channel selection volume and buttons should make it possible to zap through the channels a rabbit ever pays
room as i as i said do my presentation fifty percent was it fifteen fifty percent
talk about the working design of the shape or some gauge it's future work that out stepping
common technology like the circuit board it's the most important Part of the remote control
opening we've got three presentations and i'm gonna show
remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group but isn't that for more person you our corporate image should stay recognisable in our product for product corporate
fun i know that the younger people most likely have a dvd players like for reading
important customers which is over seventy percent of our market is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years
fun age range of ten to twelve
markets if you want to reach you use markets like elderly people mu have to choose form of issues butts
spend base unit underneath it is also round brown's
compromise we could make is just to make one teletext browsing
day i've never seen that before you make it and they use you'd with the mother the mouses nowadays can last two years three years with two batteries maybe we use large battery source for one rose
individual round was half an hour
remote control for television you don't need to be able to program the vcr to start recording at three pm or whatever just play stop
users it saps all rsi court of hear from the results I said buttons
bow a couple weeks ago i looked at for the slides and there are a lot of slides in one page which consists of more pages and you are not a very quick read
world and the components are very very cheap for light thing around it or that did it that it lights
program should be there i because your hand so you are ends will be in the small pencil holders for something are more expensive
focus on the one hand the experts if you all or none of issues
lots of newer televisions can store pages and you can just get menu
relevant because we're are aiming at a young
