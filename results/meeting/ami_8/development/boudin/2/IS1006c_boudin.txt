remote control was you all the time
remote controls and speech recognition
remote control we should be easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone
asked real people who are using real remote controlled every day and or any other to me that you see that the remote control concepts
profit remote control with a lot of buttons
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
general people change tv more often than batteries on their remote control
market of remote controls they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention
simple buttons and speech recognition technology we take at least five euros or that you put some control we want to reduce
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
speaker the pen and speech recognition you want the radios
futuristic hear it would control with angles and the titanium back and not to look at a new remote controls it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole
converse to having you see the button and you can use your time on to it will take it some days to loan all these buttons
distinctive look and feel and you look they do Which people use need to the trains if we were in the world as our company
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and batteries for Really like batteries and we will good price
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser
advanced chip technology and it's more expensive compared to lcd
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology inside
location and these people are really interesting on those features
back light kills a lcd screen was different colours
rubber aspect might be important
recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology
Generally add developed quite a broad concept of the interface but for Possible instruction or users many all and so all that complex saying so it's come together with your tv and remote controls
flat different colours Depending on what is around like what colours around and depending on the temperature
simple to program where the chip do we have only the plastic or that cd five or A chip
choose that titanium smelling like fruit or do we make spongy
follow smart should be some not too complicated
lighting we have many options in the market
problem is that this design we phone that we can't use the double record shapes
ready pretty to pay
technology and so that we can have Enough space or enough money are you don't and you're out of business
colours they can be more money too bad These And the shapes and then they can have different assembly
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a i'll put that says creaky what they are actions
important to be fancy have to have a fancy look-and-feel and then interestingly
solar cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy would solar cells hand too late to just use simple battery
criterion the trends that we seen big cities like paris and milan it seems that this year think it should have a fruit and vegetable
selling point maybe it has to be the base
recogniser but we want to goals speaker independent or speaker
blue You use maybe for the addendum Nobody's expense
story that for the point before why not the rubber is expensive
plastic we stick last time
big and there's so i'm just asking them the current trends according to them when the going to store is that when they asked there are friends mine has this and that euros And finally
decision we want to take on this meeting are on the them first and component concept so what energy we use what chip on print and one cat case
fruit these teams like fruits or reject
include video i was d display for the tv you information
remember has a nokia phone we can use the phone as a good to Example of work to it beeps back
dark blue who are watching the trends there inventing it You're creating the trend i hope
conceptual design meeting in thirty minutes
record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that mark the user interface design
end we find out that it's not feasible
straight on these individual action g which are for them ram out a bit design
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
red goes faster than the life
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
work together a menu on a prototype using modelling clay
body one call really come up with our forties
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning
puts lots of concentrate
