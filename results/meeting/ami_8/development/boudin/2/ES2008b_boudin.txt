hundred a new remote control is quite subjective experience
left to we've got it's an engineering based design for a remote their own remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls in the analysing
talk about the technical functions design objectives
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy into data
device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
focusing on the designers people specifically said that it's not remotes were ugly seventy
people are only using ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote and that ties
mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled That extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design presentation and the functional requirements
lots of buttons and the relevant the polls buttons hired
money to buy a new remote all they want like an upgrade
sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls
industrial design if you're components concept user interface is for this product
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people
time of tape ten people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people losing it too if it's the it's a fun
people are so is that like change channel change the volume people
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicated
combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work or infrared bulb which will then bring
age so younger people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition
pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
backwards up down channel numbers to get a different ideas
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
components that we find here are the energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
desire for voice recognition was inverse be related to age
mentioned things like voice recognition but at the price
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
wind One large accessible buttons for the essential
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find specific target group
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
hides all the complicated buttons
imagine just it is an electronic device that allows us to do certain effects on the television
control in this index opinions on the television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen just and some text things and they looking graphics
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
deadline the target group and what are we gonna go cobble
economic we need to find a balance between features and price
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of an lcd screen was brought
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest frustration
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
receiver and in my opinion infrared
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
audio setting is then given it much important and visibility on the remote as a minute channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel settings
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros to produce
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion in electronics
instruction manual it comes at the end that's and hot because of the combination
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease
thirty minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
twenty five euro remember
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range of ages
short amount of time you get specific in crap instructions from your personal coach emailed
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
white or thereabouts draw
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
