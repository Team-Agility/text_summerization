Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or i needed buttons
mb and a lot of remote controls work it when you for you push the button the remote control supplied as you can do the buttons with a one and a dash into a dash but when you use but the remote control that doesn't support these buttons
year is in the docking station would be a fifth of the price of the remote control
remote control in remote controls and it makes stepping easy
remote control gives another signal of the five seconds remote
single it in the first place this is signal which it would also sent we put a separate button
innovative technology for remote controls one more in our you controls not in how you finder
docking station if you'd a if you choose simple chip
big deal but the remote control gets why did a state
question is who would do we need an advanced chips
colour at the colours are special the form a special
televisions you have to a click on a a special button for a if you push a button then you go to a next level you can push two buttons
plane docking station for two euros if you don't put the recharge function
button on it would like one and then a dash it's the same thing as when you just push
draw the docking station isn't relevant for this project aim
side that will be a strip of rubber buttons will be that will be matching colour between the buttons
euros and thirty cents we don't get the docking station
point out which is the volume and button supplements we'll give the buttons
visible be some special remote control dunno which is forms special material and colour
docking station and costs and such are not included in this list
functionality of that's a separate button all set to apply
simple chip and with the retriever it would be an advanced chip
simple chip then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents
remote control nowadays are they come with the television respond differently
case a low for a remote control is at least one euro
job in the first me to afford to do your first presentation to make this clear but then you have some time problems
leave it open for for there's you are because we have to reevaluate
colour as the rubber
fifty cents
feel this concept making it kinetic
remote battery and kinetic because you walk all the time
button you give one signal and the older televisions needs more signals to go level higher
kinetic part as to get some Just to give it some extra special future
cable with a buttons on it We do retrieval a device
state so the scroll wheel requires regular chip in a the display requires an advanced chip
concept there's something special left of you're right that it's the near the program button
score higher on innovative technology that it will give more signals It could work
part no appeals to me call thinking of our design intended for novas users
power device is very cheap that's just a regular
rubber parts and it's the readiness of thing and then when you move the round a lot then people find the id funny then when i move my remote control rounded
line width of colours
remote controls that down at these buttons but you still can know you can still select the twenty a number in the twenty times an hour
calculator also works on our own solar cells more projects than only remote controls
Fill in the number of components you guys using the five minute of the cost
lights on the top or the buttons they can make lights
question is usable it will be bought by people of forty
call a lot of problems The sample sensor sample speaker
components are listed over here the price of of the amount of button you have to put it in a carton board
recharger as a bit but points to to all of these to evaluate that design
lowest part of it so when it's the same as the other products go deeper
foley own it's site and the other side is the programs
display is for some numbers for some text
ten eleven twelve and thirteen
warning finish meeting
difficult because different shapes of devices
interface elements are shown in the drawing maybe you can appoint
add a discourse now to cr to laugh
end there's an infrared led
