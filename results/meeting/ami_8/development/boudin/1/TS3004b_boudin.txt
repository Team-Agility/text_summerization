reading on a page remote control just sends come on space six months to to television
remote control eight percent use would spend more money when a remote controls
points we had last meeting was should be you universal Remote control
remote control becomes a green a red button to go to the next one or two ago could prove
room so we have to understand what buttons are used to to make it universal
special all the plo eight people use standard buttons
people elderly people what they use what they want on remote control
circuit chip knows what button the like a switch
teletext option Maybe we have to skip
light under the and the numbers anything do if you press
small light around the button you push so you see green
telephone i never use those buttons to call
normal be put in the simple buttons on the top
channel above ten normally you can press
stripes so you have like at five seconds period to press the buttons and that know for elderly people to look one to press and a man
simple standards So standardise the methods like a know remote controls
point is if we made make remote control for only television it's hard to sell it for twenty five euros
divide between functions you often used like maybe switch channels and volume and that things and the menu button
automatic only search function for each television dvd players t real and vcr had a question
seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly
user to remember what channel connects to what favourite
problem to because you have to be fast enough maybe the elderly people no rights
fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons
banana what are the most things in modern tvs are also on the menu
finally have a conclusion that younger people of interest of this company are forty plus people or torture

lights emitting diode is producing infrared light this invisible
configuring the spectrum just chip is trying to switch off the television
favourites can say six in a row just numbers
optional like we discussed like ipod different colours
recognition about you said one and the television turns
receptor in the tv senses that's room
experiments was about gadgets like the speech recognition
chips sends out that's our to the infrared bulb
short time to put it on the market
chip produces a pattern Like a morse code
required because it like in a mobile phones usability
product should reach a new market this custom and our do you wanna forty so it should be flashy
Red so it shows that like something's
circuit as close to produce is the pattern
sixty five persons the city of persons of the users said they zap
method i used is search the web just web page provided
main thing is the usability that's when we can make it a special product or own style be we this is so difficult a difficulty
colours you can choose blue or yellow
