lots of people complain they kind can find your remote control button remote control function
luxury a remote control and the advanced remote controls and let them buttons
power buttons and use one time and the volume
function and the problem to programme button or change the channel switching
top goal of this meeting is to reach decision on the product on the target group and the functions of the remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote controls the multi function
round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user in what state
important button And there are lots of people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control reports
multi function and can be implemented in in our design Perfect design for those only those buttons
functions and the money that we can say from that we should use for having a design and thinking about the user interface designer
user interface connect to chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
question of and putting in advanced options
volume because maybe people do not always want to use the voice recognition
channel selection is the most important or volume selection and the teletext
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set starts to make a weights out and your remote controls
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs by not implementing a lot of functions decide it and our target audience
opinion the it be easy ease of equipment but it's quite elaborate
restriction the characteristics of clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound from other sounds which aren't exactly the same from the point if you all from remote control
numbers about the speech recognition here that's younger people do not use all the extra features
advantage is that the circuit board will become much more user if we do in that do not implement fancy techniques
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons you have that's the cheaper that the chip which just a voice recognition our circuit boards
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find the one solution
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost circuit board
hebrew i bet devices which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment
home station for base station next a tv is a bus with nancy
decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition has the main it stand
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume and the programme one and some fancy lights
imagine when you only have a set like to go there and you have about six on the channels and the old people
buy personally we should infer use infrared
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness and it can be more trendy in and use design
older you might want to constrain that portion market will Examples will change adapt
important point is that we really should use energy friendly components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger parts off the market isn't the forty percent we Want to sell
thirty minutes of time to perform are individual work for ball When it's fun
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product that is really what the market
dark concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
disadvantages that there are so concerns about the costs and things like that battery lifetime energy saving another advantage
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
