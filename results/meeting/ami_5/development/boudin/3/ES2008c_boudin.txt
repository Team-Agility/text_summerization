lots of buttons for the features
cost we should just go for push buttons which is what real reaction
user remotes you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
important features for a remote is seen a menu
matter how many buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
onscreen menu of your channel traces then you can scroll down on the scrolling
case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
buttons for your favourite channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
lcd screen there are on the actual tv and people
concepts of user interface list of device
watching tv in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons
replace and a simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip depending
bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
ri uses for buttons to me to move around so range of settings so on a small lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
solar battery you find in porches from about fifty years ago flashlights
point having a television send information back to the remote control list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
changeable covers like for your mobile in different fruit and vegetable colours we could colour
international be on we said but for all age groups different functions to keep the remote from getting lost a large buttons for the essential functions a possibility for extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
mind that these are the options of using the kinetic battery idea
model is a going to be for user interaction with this device going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
essential properties of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface the tape and the supplements
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on cost other than it's more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
imagining like double curved is like like two sides that curve gonna make one curve would just be like a single word looking thing but i have no idea
find a way to protect like the chip
minutes a new type things you look and feel design meeting and it's sending
small tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
hit my understanding of old latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
designer of our real reaction company wind focus on fashion in technological elements we can add in the word latex titanium or rubber or other coloured types of plastic
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
objectives were simplicity and fashion and just technology you eat it easy to use idea they're mine
armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
simple regular advanced chip-on-print as that machine prince on the wires and source
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
