pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
important thing people like to last year was that the remote controls
men about future of next to each other on a normal remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
small because you have how much nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the lcd screen
printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal print
main you can fit the lcd screen just use and all sex or another as cleaning consulting
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly people
spots but also possible to create fancy colours wood rubber that's or a that's used to make the case is the same colour
important position the people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
chip on print what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button on the bottom of standbys
screen they don't need that big difference between young people fresh exciting and all people
colours it was the slogan and the corporate colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
large a button or if you have several options appearing on the screen the colour nations
touch options you can't go back
remote control has no way or in the settings menu to look up some some channels on your television use is called a scroll down on a menu which probably does not fit on a screen
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
called cults settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu
personal preferences for the young peoples like a fruity colours Innovative all the colleges you blue red white yellow
round shapes As soft with the materials like the rubber is the best suits poll up material
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
specific instructions will be emails why our personal coach
morning or a coffee maker and it says that says do you back good morning joe or which made this and this the easy
people like a plain normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
option to use as a in a rather simple chip
easy to have it something like but and minus here the sofa here Minus
shapes like a week you said is that's easy better or for the elderly people something like that Like the ipod do something with the round shapes
chip on print think cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
schools it is in the actual design and user interface are also some questions about the concepts you have some ideas
explain some properties of the material
point we already decided that on the previous meeting
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium or you have to pay chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip
menu for button channel volume we should also be enough for easy
soft but if you should the feelings spongy use of sponge bob like face
overheard to the last meeting that they should we should use our own business colours
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty minutes of use Nx
sense that it you ask you give a question so the device into the speaker
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
findings in new technology for speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
