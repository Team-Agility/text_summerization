sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control hear she expects the buttons to be in certain places
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
energy source your user interfaces controlling the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared
technical functions design how the apparatus can fulfil its function
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people
time of tape ten people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people who have problems with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
industrial design if you're components concept user interface is for this product
parts of the working design presentation i have a pet
focusing on the designers people specifically said that it's not remotes were ugly seventy
people are so is that like change channel change the volume people
money to buy a new remote all they want like an upgrade
components that we find here are the energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
Space is similar to a very basic weapons you have like you have numbers and sports colours
control so it's one has got lots of buttons with essentials
age so younger people didn't really care for voice recognition
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
control in this index opinions on the television remote controls in the analysing
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
investment should use novel idea of an lcd screen was brought
fifty percent of the people mention that was the biggest frustration
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find specific target group
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
audio setting is then given it much important and visibility on the remote as a minute channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel settings
combination of electrical energy is converted To port it's practical function
find a balance between features and price as you mentioned
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
instruction manual it comes at the end that's and hot because of the combination
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion in electronics
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
seventy five percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease
voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros to produce
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range of ages
short amount of time you get specific in crap instructions from your personal coach emailed
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
white or thereabouts draw
narrow down to maybe Teenagers and families
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
