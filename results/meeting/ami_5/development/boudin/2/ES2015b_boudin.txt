wheely the willing to spend money on a remote control personality as opposed to a basic
discussing be functional requirements of this remote controls are often lost somewhere so those are discuss
multifunctional remote controls for older and chi minh devices and the single function remote control
compatible with the range of television set I taking inspiration from although similar designed built rank up with a directional trendy remote control which is celp or international
eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote controls
hire number of people want gotta turn on the tv with the remote control
array shows time or obtainable as we have less function on the side of things to include in the design of the apparatus is the fact the apparatus
field of research fit be if it's to have a remote if you're talking to a television and saying change channel
room in the project folder to make a more original design we'll have more money
large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls so i'll show you some numbers
design purposes the lighting of thing might be better because the dark material has a funny colour of our our company motto on purpose
cell in a cellphone a light up remote control thing lights up for ten seconds when it's touch
bite for the purposes of this meeting i wasn't offered a like a type of logo what colour so if i could be some more on the design so we can be recognisable
practical an lcd screen or a remote control would be that furthering that problem
television set Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average four times an hour relevance of three channel settings
end maybe use it would put and that project to the company this product responsibility for all the companies are coming up with make new designs
Channel changers that a lot of the numbers game rub down if they're printed on the button that you press the menu
multi function controls can be difficult to use as a lot shape of buttons which we're all familiar with when we using a mobile phone
decisions is that the management feels that teletext is outdated because more people using the internet
easier to make it compatible with different brands of devices
start to get a new tv has like information has information on holidays and use entertainment
design thing for now because or try to do so much that if we can make a unique user-friendly that that is also a lot of also on multifunctional we're gonna go over budget
youngest age group fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend remote control like their priorities
touch the powerpoint for at this meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of a design
object and find be multifunctional
guest as for my findings looks that one minimise buttons
Receive my emails later on i was too busy carry do it in their mind the reliability of our research
arrow down arrow for volume selection to ten at and it's used on average
profitable like as a sideline to the remote to sell
product for as long as they felt that they wanted it and then once they contributed then that company can break down the part the parts a party really should be unique design
week me possibly to incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers and cells and be made out of some the dark material
remember from the email we got for a very first kick-off meeting with the coffee machine the functional requirements
cells that but then you'd like a pattern and down button for the channel changing
previous researchers have hard on some other projects with leds about smart materials flat specific how ease of medals have a shape memories
materials which would just i'm taking the light during the day in and as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark you put the real reaction some ball at school in the dark and then it would be constantly put rice
trends that are going on in the public even be the who's famous
scrap metal something like the case if it's scratch does anyone wants we use it but you might be able to market with fashionable products
face plates end of this to start making more complicated
reaching international crowd i know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext option
idea one thing we have to consider is our one hundred percent turnover goal that we have for our financial sector
medals or would we contribute another group we're targeting young adults it looks like something that would pay
final circuit get sides can would call those components is will be how with the wheel actually work
'em bits and the basic jobs you can wear out with time all not usable they might be like Bill that's going to scrap metal
press and the alarm from the handset would sound where it was hopefully in the room
raise what's the energy source it could be a battery like rechargeable
