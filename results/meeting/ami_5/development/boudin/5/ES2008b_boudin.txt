sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control hear she expects the buttons to be in certain places
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
energy source your user interfaces controlling the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared
mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled That extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people
time of tape ten people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people who have problems with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
industrial design if you're components concept user interface the user interface concept market trend were watching
easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task a step
focusing on the designers people specifically said that it's not remotes were ugly seventy
big buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the channel play stop volume people
frozen he can show me to pick up the remote all they want like an upgrade
components that we find here are the energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
Space is similar to a very basic weapons you have like you have numbers and sports colours
record the frequency that they use particular buttons and the relevant the polls buttons with essentials
specific for speech recognition was inverse be related to age so younger people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice activation
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
crap remote taking with their tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television remote controls in the analysing
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of an lcd screen was brought
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find specific target group were saying fifteen to thirty
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
audio setting is then given it much important and visibility on the remote as a minute channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel settings
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
economic we need to find out find a balance between features and price as you mentioned
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
instruction manual it comes at the end you just only when really going on or even that those things can go out and you're happy
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
seventy five percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple
voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range of ages
short amount of time you get specific in crap instructions from your personal coach emailed them to you and also putting
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
white or thereabouts draw
narrow down to maybe Teenagers and families
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
