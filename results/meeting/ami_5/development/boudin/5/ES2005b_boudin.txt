remote control we design have ago better a better broke read their designs then we can hope that consumers and that for this the remote controls
market for the available remote control last time Where do we add speech recognition as as the glow in the dark and ball these factors will have the locating the remote controls but in this what profit
remote control by the tv speaker and transmitter there it sends back to remote
functions in their remote controls we should emphasise but actually can do more hard for the operate better than making it too complicated
feature which which is brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection future for when you lose your remote like people
define that If you a word there were problems they're having the current remote control so available in the market Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls to bulky too complicated too expensive and it but i believe that technologies use it only if the consumers
sorta speech interface to it you only need to find the finer things it's could probably make a circuit diagram
remote controls and we should provide close by problem and no suffice to use also so as that they would go there was could easily lead
consumers they're willing to have pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not we can find that came up to a thirty five years is a joke we have a very good disliking for this this for a blind like for speech recognition and rocket power
remote control know what's been produced by the television manufacturers to put that feature into their tvs
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television set that so people
concerned way of What effect be a greater should have on the user interface for this to be just a bunch of buttons
work for a while though because of this noise reference problem they mentioned
setting is really very important point it's if we look at the market those people
mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people like glow in the dark about this sectors
detailed market survey on consumers was bound to find out that like incentives like kings what the press forward in or breath or what problems they do encounter in all this type
information to rise cases was very useful but what people other people between twenty five and thirty five where the main and by is of rtv
exist it's not very widely use i don't think easy find a with a whistle functional
important because tft of just released is it at a remote control for presentations so and a big grey
told us that Consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products don't always match users operating behaviour
telephone that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons
stick that's program ability and for the buttons and if you hit that menu the top
user can put in their favourite channels and then you so like a bbc too and bbc one or switch the channel or to turn on and start blasting
idea of And feedback so of remote finder then that kinda
care of this vector also like our design should be appropriate should be good looking for the consumers
caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your tv that and you can press and i'll send out a little signals
personally worked with all these products i have a great deal of experience with the industrial designer
pretty in the house or say that in this a day in this part or age group from fifteen to thirty
reaction turn all yellow strip forty year low skilled in the logo on as bright yellow
noise over certain threshold on a topic up as a distress signal on from you and i'll be back the rf The rf remote ideas
logo and so the slogan we put fashion in electronics so we as the company we want to make a product trendy in fashions a big concern
low tech and not too many buttons set appeal on to consideration when i was a profit sense
chance to the tft or the lcd thing is if you're also wanting
material is Maybe not this a tail maybe more like this work for a materials cheap but it's just the go on the dark your needs some like a charger
people would require and teletext in a remote teletext because it's become outdated everybody uses the internet
position alloys that's the bells and whistles that we mentioned it take more budgeting more technical expenditure of effort
speak recognition limited buttons organic shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corners
week as we said colours and fashion were important so maybe just like little line this around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour options they want corporate colour and slogan some higher implemented the new design
realistically then we need a product that's got some kind an ft outer casing cheap plastic
nineteen euro is we've got our we've got make a profit or our aims
shout your command to it do it for you if it's within what i'm hearing range
update but it anyway so your hand that they require of that it's very hard
base station so essentially that we had decided in the last meeting so that much to forward on tva
