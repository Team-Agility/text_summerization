cheap remote control market so we found that people will people do have preference for the design the outlook of the remote controls is graphical interface
remote control and casings of different shapes different fruit shape so in such a way that any giving can you could be fit
easy to like at the different shapes of the buttons in translates into the sequence of courses that it then sends the amplifier
people want like if somebody wanted in banana shaped we will put that case we want to that war waveform
buttons do we want to just have a device that maybe sets and pretend it's a fruit
easy because there will be on lcd c display in the room a different friend i you can just critical whatever the war
idea to you then i will these table so she was then people use mile mice mouse is now with the scrolling
include either with the rid of it some remotes and we give something new technology got are the ones where and as as new design it fancy outlook we really need the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market
fashions this and fashion the holidays and fashion update shows that fruit and veggie there was a people
factor of this vector is the most important factor in others are in our market means and take in designing our our remote controls
buttons option on one side you get the fashion on the other side with the microphones so you can place it face time
setting would actually going for speech thing you said are take now our research and development department saying that they have broken three would certainly speech recognition software that you can programme
people have a later date clothes shoes and furniture everything that fruit and veggie day was to be process is that what they were data
play-doh latex as a kinda spongy feel of the material is expected to be spongy the other than just having a plastic look a hard
doubles as a standard parts and for using it as a recharging of also for using it as send recognition is that you keep on keep in the microphone
lay that it's got like a little scroll function on the side but i presume
interface where you have cops buttons and you point to it rather than having the output is a stream of text
important aspect in the data to take into consideration is that it should be easy to understand in the local language
wider for a banana design caving in such a way like half of what we need not to have a full colour we will just have a half of colour
today to be they have got they are going crazy with the lcd technology this as a man we small and cheap
double curved send it to me if we're talking about three or can we can easy
rechargeable battery will be a good idea but then they have to keep them and they are more whites outside the solar energy
standard off the shelf a chip roster the ta one eight three five which on their see the input and which adds
options from wood or titanium rubber plastic casing and then the buttons and property two different colours
easily have the main body blue with the yellow logo and Slogan running up one side
twenty five thirty five euros a cat or twelve years fifteen manufacturing
work on giving me a model in clay
specific functions all that in a play stop it got a minute
scroll it and then when you reach the a menu item that you require you pressed the middle of a scroll wheel and speech recognition
harm to the environment also because our company colours the lemon wasn't that far I have it doesn't work
parts like even mobile phones whatever have that colour lcd screens
processor are more pro use a more advanced processor than i had and find transmitter a standard
light run x the more features we add
discussion over less anybody's got questions you have to rise the last meeting just to save time
company is very light up there for taking all this concerns into consideration
program it like you say you record and then play you and then the court time
open up there's a circuit board we have to use bc at the same setup processor
secure areas and i've seen a lot of them with the cover missing so like other hand like what it is portable phones
rl the data but it is good for have ten which is quite this for the one that we can begin
instructions will be sent by your personal coaches
preference is just a imagination the race symbols everything but it's pointing
price and price not withstanding is it too complicated it's it can be too much just overloaded
automatically if you put in project documents as you want project document
promote any size we like or is there a minimum
pushing it probably bit funny fruitshaped
