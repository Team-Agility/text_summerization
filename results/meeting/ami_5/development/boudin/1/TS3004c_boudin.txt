ordinary remote controls as good morning remote control
curved remote controls we must use rubber buttons
document be sent to the station of the remote control and the recharger
basic buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons
top buttons we don't use some in the bottom
current controllers are all black and plastic then the buttons
volume channel to choose channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons
back lights look will look very new one know rubber buttons
volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake
modern remote controls the buttons are part so focuses on these two parts
important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel instead of the current functional look-and-feel so it's very important
numbers should be in the bottom and the switch channel in the middle
shape should be curved So round shapes not nothing square
man a young public you should use materials or soft with primary colours like green blue red so Flashy kinda colours the shape
buttons normal rubber like normal ordinary buttons soft
basic care colour fronts
light blue and transparent
sense if you put it somewhere in the chances the beautiful scroll wheel
spec to the remote control should be easy to know me for a push to the yup
main points said You have to be original in technological innovative big door
chip so if we use speech recognition it would be better to implement lcd
recognition We i don't think we should put it on top band that if we gonna put in more technology eugene need to be able to switch to open
drop it you wanna change the volume and top down is more with the channel changing
yellow on the side and black on the front
expensive most expensive chip if we use an lcd
original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod And and three players mobile phones
divide you have to round it on the button and of skip
date display in the ipod a compared to the basic
display requires an advanced chip can be a simple a regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced
room no just battery context like normal batteries just a rechargeable batteries expense
country use different for fronts that's always know the logo
receive information about the cost but just a about the chip
slide in the docking station
sense for an original look and feel of the case and interface
product you by your get one and more basic or you can choose one if you buy the project
kinetic a like but the polls watch so it operates
usability is very important people that want to spend money on something that's similar devices and my own common knowledge
target group we talk about was young public
case transparent on the wise the backlight one work together on a prototype drawing a smartboard
design so i did some searching on the internet
tad next aspect also in contrast to last year the feel of material suspect it is expected to the role on this one at this moment
telephone also have a lcd and that's about two hundred euros
developed a new speech recognition feature integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit is a very small electronic units will give a standard answer of should recognise the question
