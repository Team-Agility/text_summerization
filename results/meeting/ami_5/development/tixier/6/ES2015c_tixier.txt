test will have to look at how the remote control
cost of buttons functions will show
command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data

half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentation
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
