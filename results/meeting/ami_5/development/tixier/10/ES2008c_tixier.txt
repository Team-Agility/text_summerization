lots of buttons for all the features
cost we should just go for push buttons which is what real reaction
hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
important features for a remote is seen a menu
depending them a week at a button to switch off in case you get bored
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu button so that we can access
simply it's cheaper to make pushbuttons and it is a scroll thing would be too fast
case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel flipping and then the other white
lcd screen there are on the actual tv and people
concept of the user interface
tend to watch tv i them wanting to say on the tv and watch
circuit board and chip we can have a simple to shaking around will make it work
bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
fashion in our case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
television send information back to the remote control list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
buttons could be shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours maybe free vegetable colours
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
intrigued by the idea that these are the options of using the kinetic battery
member of that this is the device that is going to be useful to people
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
user face we're gonna have to decide the interface and we'll come back to the chip
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
imagining like double curved like would that be like two hands time i am imagining
find a way to protect on the inside
fun doing it components design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
small tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these question on the weight of these different elements
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
chip-on-print the chip-on-print include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
