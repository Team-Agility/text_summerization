easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
basic function if you are going to use the advanced options are going to press
easy so for just a zapping around channels you can just push one button
concentrate more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen
clear which buttons to scroll up and down and left or right to go into function
menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional functionality
pretty handy for advanced a advanced one but a lot of options and functions
hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle of it says menu
navigate the channel and left or right for the volume channel up and down screen
people use mobile phone and also have a screen on top
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
channel five and phone account channel anything you want to move the only kind to channel
remote like this if you put it on the top and then make the corporate logo
layout of the remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
wary of space left and then put a logo
reach a little bit for the power cable when you go back
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program the channel programming
corporate identity should be clear in the design of the bus buttons but look how you can push them and like that so the physical aspect
press a button and the teacher a goes It it sends a signal to a chip which are translates
optional maybe you can go left or right end up and down in a in one menu
confirm a want to go one step back to it to upper level which twos and focus
problem mean you are you a car and channel number do you want to save
sound settings if you do is like a very and now base you need to change
match the operating behaviour of the users are not afraid of a lot of functions
features the above forty people are not so interests and to not interested in the screen and the speech recognition
functions and on the Seems was it the target that's a group of forty
selection so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
television itself is also the options that brightness and screen settings mono stereo page
basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
elderly people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television with that usually three buttons and very hard
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
microphone it can be very small phones are just are some stripes a little holes
threw it at transformer it's the signal gets a boost that and then sent to the tv and that if you will Translated into a function
simple and all that advanced features but we just have to build them in because they find
room that's it's actually a part of your interior of off you're designing your room
product should reach a new market which is the customers below forty so we could skip the features
received an email so i'd like we'll use so i'd just drop it in the folder
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
spend a lot of time to integrate that information that i need so frustrating
news flash and teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
overview of what we discussed in our last Meeting
open it with the picture preview
lli d and then just was typing it so that all i have to that so switch
