idea because you if you and you drop your remote control and remote controls
hold it you can't all the control and push the buttons
document be sent to the station of the remote control in a recharger
compared to the basic buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons
pretty standard these rubber buttons are wish there should be on top
Basic remote control are all black and plastic it's that our problem
switch channel up and down button and that takes a few buttons more often than the normal channel of the time
Light switches on if you use a button you knew a lot more like the that meant that and they three player
volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake
modern remote controls the buttons are part of the just it's part of the remote control
find that the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy and it looks original
numbers should be in the bottom and the switch channel in the middle
shape should be curved So round shapes not nothing square
real reaction logo as on the remote controls so the colours blue red and green colour the backlight
buttons normal rubber like normal ordinary buttons soft
basic care colour fronts
fancy because of the lights on the bottom that's what difference
sense if you put it somewhere in the chances the beautiful scroll wheel will still the plo
spec to the remote control should be easy if it's below it's harder to zap
important aspect and we must use some of the new technology to be innovative
integrated in the chip so if we use speech recognition it would be better to implement lcd
top band that if we gonna put in more technology eugene need to be able to switch to open
left or right is more often associating with volume and top down is more with the channel changing
deciding yellow and it did the top and black and yellow the world
expensive most expensive chip We need if we doing if we're doing a display
original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod And and three players mobile phones
divide you have to round it on the button and of skip
date display in the ipod a compared to the basic
chip can be a simple a regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced
energy source we can use batteries just a rechargeable battery that's cheaper
low if we will a lot of room to put in as logo
strange that i receive information about the cost but just a about the chip
slide in the docking station
sense for an original look and feel of the case and interface
product you by your get one and more basic or you can choose one if you buy the project
kinetic a like but the polls watch so it operates
people that want to spend money on something that's similar devices and my own common knowledge
target group we talk about was young and trendy
uid work together on a prototype drawing a smartboard
show you the And i the the menu to that what's it called
tad next aspect also in contrast to last year the feel of material suspect it is expected to be spongy
telephone also have a lcd and that's about two hundred euros
