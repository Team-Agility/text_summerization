research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech recognition
people are what it about the shape of the remote control when they broke brought to hold
feed the targets in front of cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
bring new technologies for young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen
button it increases the difficulty of find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
increasing the unit price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
application and then shape of the buttons is important but also it the number of buttons
speech recognition technology does mean sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find
channel than a one i what i use a remote to change the lighting in the room
watching tv you can have a lot of these background noise from a tv to superimpose that is this menu
pretty wide range of remote control shouldn't be very they have looked pretty comfortable if you want to get this and on top
natural that we have a product to really that work it does work was supposed to work on the components concepts
restrict the remote control to tv only because of time but on the On the chip
cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
tv we can use a tv screen as the screen to feed back to do some feedback informations
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press a button
idea but as a marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition
channel already what's on If you have a list of programmed an lcd screen you just scroll for that program name instead of the channel
extra internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
working design is so user interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons
personal preference was that we can have a us are sitting there on the remote control
red so if you go to the market and you say that buttons that they're the People to use on line which a case of by speak
live in a little in each of the the main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
teletext but we want to get read one of four requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should be similar to the traditional
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology switch at existing so deeply the book would be which is the easiest
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
master a very easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting the green one and it can watch
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
brings us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet aspects because you see the text is outdated
forces you had a company which is putting the fashion in electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
bet they may not have pictures but maybe they the there's the penny
selling the potential of the device in use a potentially you can then do a look like change the lights and i close the windows what about the heating
eds they're more like and they good idea is to it looks like a year
mount the for the naming we see fault for the look-and-feel later so let's go for this representation
english it sounds like them and school you know men
average then quincy off by some bottom
