easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
design the basic function if you are going to use the advanced options are going to press
easy so for just a zapping around channels you can just push one button and one navigation button
screen is to concentrate more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen
clear which buttons to scroll up and down and left or right to go into function
menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu in the lcd screen
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional functionality
Channel up and down and the control of the advanced one but a lot of options and functions and buttons is easy
hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle of it says menu
navigate the channel and left or right for the volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation button
people use mobile phone and also have a screen on top
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
channel five and phone account channel anything you want to move the only kind to channel
remote like this if you put it on the top and then make the corporate logo
time to learn how to use a new remote control options so we need to menus
wary of space left and then put a logo
reach a little bit for the power cable when you go back
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program is how to seek
corporate identity should be clear in the design of the bus buttons but look how you can push them and like that so the physical aspect
press a button and the teacher a goes It it sends a signal to a chip which are translates
optional maybe you can go left or right end up and down in a in one menu
confirm a want to go one step back to it to upper level which twos and focus
week or on the channel and then it just say is which number do you want to save
visuals of the bride this with that sliding bar and the boss and the like that for sound and then within sounds i trouble on base you need to change
match the operating behaviour of the users are not afraid of a lot of functions or make the buttons as user-friendly
features the above forty people are not so interests and to not interested in the screen and the speech recognition
functions and on the Seems was it the target that's a group so it's above forty
selection so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
irrelevant the less use for audio settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour etcetera
basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television with that usually three buttons and very hard
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
microphone it can be very small phones are just are some stripes a little holes
threw it at transformer it's the signal gets a boost that and then sent to the tv and that if you will Translated into a function
clear distinction between age groups concerning the features but we just have to build them in because they find
communication if the television it's difficult but that's not hard part you don't have to design
product should reach a new market which is the customers below forty so we could skip the features
received an email so i'd like we'll use so i'd just drop it in the folder
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
spend a lot of time thinking about what i was gonna do and then a couple minutes before this i get my fun to the information
news flash and teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
overview of what we discussed in our last Meeting
open it with the picture preview
lli d and then just was typing it so that all i have to that so switch
