discussing be functional requirements of this remote control are often lost somewhere so those are discuss
target group and the function of the remote control we've decided not to include them and make it a specific just a specific television
case it's a function of remote control which is to send messages to the television set
seventy five percent didn't specify the feel of them are fun and neutral eighty percent of User

bringing to the meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of a design
object and find be multifunctional
guest as for my findings looks that one minimise a balance we're not gonna make them actually larger
Receive my emails later on i was too busy carry do it in their mind the reliability of our research
filling out what it for more than what ten at and it's used on average
