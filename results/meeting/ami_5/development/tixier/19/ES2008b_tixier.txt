left to we've got it's an engineering based design for a remote control
device control what we want to do it sends a message
chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared
working designers figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source
lots of buttons and that might be older people
designing several different at the types of user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
easiest thing to do is gonna be work
pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume
bothered to pick up the remote all they want like an upgrade
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
control so it's one has got lots of buttons
feel like voice recognition was inverse be related to age
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicate
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
question earlier on whether this is going to be to for television
talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
target group that means that is very few we need to each group
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings adjust brightness
combination of electrical energy is converted To port it's practical function
economic we need to find a way of striking a balance
bring the data is projected to the receiver
includes an emphasis on making the infrared very functional
marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying
operate a chip and convert that much data
instruction manual it comes at the end of the spectrum
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
number to make it technologically the end of select
seventy five percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple
price limit of the twelve and a half euro without having to make too many of a compromise
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
Switch the quality a quality of the chair
short amount of time you'll be able to access more of the website
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
white or thereabouts draw
narrow down to maybe Teenagers and families
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
