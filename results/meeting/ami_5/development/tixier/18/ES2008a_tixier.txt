remote control it should actually work
assume that it's just a television
buttons and you have to pass to actually turn on the tv
remote that has the main function of the on off channel changing volume and at the right remote with all the special
creating a new remote control which we have three goals about it needs to be original
industrial design only now we doing on the working design
remotes around my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes
individual work and a meeting
watching tv i have a we separate remote controls of in front of me and one for the tv one for the digital box one for the video recorder
stick to having television on the top it simpler to show us buttons
generate a little bit of discussion
tv that you have to do one for the power the tv
play in the court and stop buttons on the tvd recorder
working on this one for about twenty so we continue
user interface designer that's real that's Technical functions i like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons on the user requirements
programmed into it's all just in a separate place and not like all the on button see a doctor
continue discussing more new ideas
define this up in the three compact three parts first the functional design
hoping that we can all work together to achieve
define what or aiming for if it's just a television
simple are just to just run on the television
recorder or programme it's other things that i'm not a coherent
save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would need to use every day
powerpoint presentation for us for the kick-off meeting
end up to multimedia overload it just wanna watch
rose and then i'll be the project manager
tv on that note that happen on the remote a number of a beep or a corporate so now in terms of how we're gonna make it but if it's like all the tv set
sounds like we've had a good little session for our first ideas mind
necessarily it's i have a solution favourite animal
supply and i really wanna do is change the channel
individual actions and then we'll come back
discussion that we've been having we'll get from the actual concern is consumers
meeting starts in thirty minutes and probably numbers
concrete things to continue next time
tech rid of animals they can split
bob of into a quaint and so just going to know each other little bit including a tool training exercise a normal
opening and then i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project bob of into a quaint
Large if you have older people
range we do have to worry about specifics
order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro So we're sell
pretty neat little tools
user requirements so do we hearing about different runs how about different things that people
specific instructions sent by your personal coach i realised
lazy like mean the print outs
