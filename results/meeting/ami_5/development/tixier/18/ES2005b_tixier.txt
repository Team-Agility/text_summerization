companies that thing that they show them what are more functions of the users in their remote controls
add speech recognition as as the glow in the dark and ball these factors will have the locating the remote control
built since the tv there which might make a remote control of the obsolete
easy to learn how to operate these remote controls
feature which which is brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature or noise
Seventy five percent of the country where they find too difficult to operate a remote control
sorta speech interface to it you only need to find
build spacecraft you'll have no problem of the remote control
consumers they're willing to have pay more for speech recognition and whistling
remote control know what's been produced by the television
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television
user interface for this to be just a bunch of buttons
work for a while though because of this noise reference problem they mentioned
functions for tv but as you pointed out people
speak something of the remote control it applies to something and it glows in the dark
detailed market survey on consumers was bound to find
people other people between twenty five and thirty five where the main and by is of rtv
easy find a with a whistle functional
press the pick want to get on to the big
told us that Consumers are willing to spend more for fancy product
telephone that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons
number of button and if you hit
remote for to switch the channel
durable and that can also be economic and it kinda
miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and how it fixed
watching the tv and then also made it pick up the noise and turn
work with all these product i have a great deal of experience with the industrial designer
twenty five to thirty five is the usual
integrating the rabbit integrate the logo
noise over certain threshold on a topic up as a distress signal on from you and i'll be back
electronics so we as the company we want to make a product trendy in fashion a big concern
major factor to load take into consideration
cheaper than tft it's just a microphone and some integrated circuits
material is Maybe not this a tail maybe more like this work for a materials
definite requirements that they will that we need to scroll
bells and whistles we gotta come up with a gimmick but not too complicated
popular shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corner
fashion were important so maybe just like little line this around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour and slogan some higher implemented the new design
realistically then we need a product that's got some kind an ft outer casing cheap
nineteen euro is we've got our we've got make a profit
subtract a cancellation of the noise
update but it anyway so your hand held portable
decided in the last meeting and then we ended
cost more like as opposed to with batteries
