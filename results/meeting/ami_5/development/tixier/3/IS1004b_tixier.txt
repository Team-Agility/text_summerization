research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech recognition
list people are what it about the shape of the remote control
feed the targets in front of cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen
find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
television remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
application and then shape of the buttons like say the number of buttons
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition technology
channel than a one i what i use a remote to change the lighting in the room
watching tv you can have a lot of these background noise from a tv to superimpose that is this menu
pretty wide range of remote control shouldn't be very they have looked pretty
industrial designer should work was supposed to work on the components concepts
restrict the remote control to tv only because of time but on the On the chip
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared to also use going to implement
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
tv we can use a tv that we can work with and grab information
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press a button
requirements i'd give it a marketing report is to tv remote court
channel already what's on If you have a list of programmed an lcd screen you just scroll for that programme name instead of the channel
extra internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
user interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons
personal preference was that we can have a us are sitting there on the remote control
red so if you go to the market and you say that buttons which are not betty
live in a little in each of the the main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
seoul extend past the hand shape and it should not be really small
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology switch at existing so deeply the book would be which is the easiest
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting the green one and it can watch
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
focus more on the internet aspects because you see the text is outdated
electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
bet they may not have pictures but maybe they the there's the penny
selling the potential of the device in use a potentially you can then do a look like change the lights and i close the windows what about the heating
eds they're more like and they good idea is to it looks like a year
scd e still on this get used to open about this cd
english it sounds like them and school you know men
average then quincy off by some bottom
