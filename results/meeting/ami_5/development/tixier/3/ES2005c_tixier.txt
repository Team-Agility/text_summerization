bare essentials that we need to have a remote control should be a technologically
identified as a fruit shape so in such a way that any giving can you could be fit
easy to like at the different shape and up in a in this button buttons
engineered so we ended up make it different difficult shape realistic banana shape
buttons do we want to just have a device that maybe sets and pretend it's a fruit
survey findings was that they want to easy to use a i'm not about the lcd
people are we doing to be able to but they want the choir
designed to share then we can have a public some of the led to probably choose
pictures of some a new remote controls to show you that press
trend is going to affect a remarkable attention and how important factor
buttons will be on the upper side you can have a banana look all apple
speech thing it doesn't have to be hand held a closed you can set
fruit and veg a day was to be process is that what they were data
functional look and feel good you should have a fancy look and for the feel of the material
doubles as a standard parts and for using it as a recharging of also for using it as send recognition
lay that it's got like a little scroll function on the side but i presume
point to it rather than having the output is a stream of text
important aspect in the data to take into consideration is that it should be easy to talk
meeting in half an hour glass half of what we need not to have a full colour we will just have a half of colour
today to be they have got they are going crazy with the lcd technology this as a man we small and cheap
oval double curved send it to me if we're talking about three or can we can easy
basis of like reading room of battery will be a good idea
standard off the shelf a chip we need to buy input from the buttons
cover the rubber all the plastic casing this email i got from our manufacturing team
colours so and all in yellow tend to go to together crs main body
twenty five thirty five euros a cat or twelve years fifteen manufacturing
work on giving me a model in clay
specific functions all that in a play stop it got a minute
scroll it and then when you reach the a menu item that you require you pressed the middle of a scroll wheel and speech recognition
necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company
presume that the functions was come up on the tv screen
lead to do it in to find out that and was into the lower
light run x the more features we add to the cost as we can expect
questions you have to rise the last meeting i'm going to discuss what the trend watching
company is very light up there for taking all this concerns into consideration
program it like you say you record and then play up just play just accidentally deleted
open up there's a circuit board we have to use bc at the same setup processor
secure areas and i've seen a lot of them with the cover missing so like other hand like what it is portable phones
ten which is quite this for the one that we can begin
instructions will be sent by your personal coaches
preference is just a imagination the race symbols everything but it's pointing
price and price not withstanding is it too complicated it's it can be too much just overloaded
automatically if you put in project documents as you want project document
promote any size we like or is there a minimum
pushing it probably bit funny fruitshaped
