remote control so maybe you can keep it for would be you're not obliged
focus on the go control and just a would be controller fancy
concept to see the however voice control concepts
meet the user requirements i'm just who's sort and then the use of the remote control
find out if it is somewhere in the room if you may be feeding in the table is there you go to say it's triangle one and this is the remote control
time to show was modelling at the play-doh remote control
voice recognition are they just recognition object you just want to interacts
Technology is the for the immediate were really need to the mexican recognition
speech or just to recognition system will be able to instead of french
easy to use it's not so important actually with respect
user of compromise that is also the use of the tv and not on the remote control
add for a lot of some function of the controller that the functional
tv in the dark so if you want to fine you're fine your remote control of these are lost in the dark
receiver to record a gesture of a power always speech and gesturing
fancy look-and-feel is the most important one and then if we combine
tv and just to recognise gestures and voice of the gesture
overview of what is the fashion we want it to be in the remote control
product it is technology has already been developed
small tv simple them to read they're all comparable or without any breaks are in features
comparable to be easy to use and the fifty functions so it's a combination
hard it is easy which an impression a piece and in addition
present the concept and the user interface would be very cute
team Expert told us most of the people want to have a spongy touch
battery would it be something really that will increase the price of prediction
product is works matter percent reliable we do replace it with another man
rely my hand or percent on these features we can attract a lot of user
words all the time do you think it will work everybody wanting to change channels in the same time
tune into the channel four channel three channel for some of the all the size
Technical as the sun interface designer speak first is to take heed jordan
teed off and kind income for a dv you if you have the control save ten
boat and that is the button are a light at the end of the night
work more power on the spongy way to add spongy and touch to the buttons
credited to energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add
part of the maybe wood and design
year is that every scene from clothes shoes and furniture is easy inspired by fruits and vegetables
bob and david jordan you'll have to work together on the prototype
attract will be a call to call three series some research and cd
similar to what i've said in the previous meeting will start in thirty meeting minutes
Stick to the first part so what's the difference between that and it's a comparable
show you some picture of what the inside and out as a different component
point is you were so we do want to have some very cheap Integrated circuits chips or do we have to lower level or very expensive
chip on print so you if you propose lot of all chips would be a and off to have something working
switching from one country cut corners it'd be a problem
find maybe we will close the position
real slice the president
