remote control
easy to use as a remote control of that and if we can provide you guys think it's a good sell
remote control is Is to be something useful that i'm going to talk
simple button and speech recognition technology we take at least five euros or that you put some control we want to reduce
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
back and not to look at a new remote controls it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole
expensive since we want to port some other features that speech recognition
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons
integrate some into our remote control something like a light kills a lcd screen was different colours
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and batteries
chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive compared to lcd
marriage are all The Brawl the way of saying the thing if we look back
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology inside
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser
location and these people are really interesting on those features or they really like They're more want these fancy features
young people the young people want to be different from their friends
concept of the interface we used and if there is some supplements
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
Line that maybe you can colours around and depending on the temperature
sixty then you make a lot of money are you don't and you're out of business
chip do we have only the plastic or that cd five or A chip
week about the last year now it has to be spongy
plastic we stick with two batteries solar smart
talk about with their friends mine has this and that euros And finally
interestingly this is the very most important thing it has to be fancy
touchpad it just a display for the tv you information
story that for the point before why not the rubber is expensive
ready in the post and down to locate then we have to go for some speaker
propose but the use of solar cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy would solar cells hand
end we find out that it's not feasible in terms of sponginess
shape it has to be more wrong than the More roo look natural
blue You use maybe for the addendum Nobody's expense
record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
friends you can travel from golf to furniture so it might be fruit and vegetable
component to use for energy and the media and the interface for energy
phone we can use the phone as a good to Example of work to it beeps back
trend i hope i'm going to try to help you want that this is more risky
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that Mark
reduce the cost on the display would only be displayed and not a touch sensitive
selling point maybe it has to be the base
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
work together a menu on a prototype using modelling clay
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning
