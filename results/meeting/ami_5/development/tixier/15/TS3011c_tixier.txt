remote control and talking to it but it still need to points to the television
possibility for us to use scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons
scroll wheels i also have some information
hold a remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb So in that case
personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control you just rub on the cover so you're up on the painting
double scroll button in the scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons
volume button and either on the side or the side a of remote control would be perfect
high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
watching a movie and you haven't channel you have chosen like that often the amount of time Any wanted to switch the channel
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
note if you want to use these rubber with one curve User
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular
voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
customers specifically ask for the spongy feel of the material has to be spongy
casing is curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch
colouring is important and soft material but not real spongy
imagine it's a bit like a wave form
fruit you have to colours We have to simple design of the look and feel The user interface design
traditional devices on this market
suggest we use the sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip
voice recognition you say i were you can program words like volume
kinetic thing it is it's possibility is more sense of it and you can store
yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours
watch you have the kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it's against the wall
fruit and vegetables are important but innovation is more important than Ease of use for the our target group
discussion the digits six on the bus and it will disappear when it's from rubber
cost rating on the young group like fruit and vegetables In their clothes shoes and furniture
latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cell solution for the energy
simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar panel and hand dynamo
bet i understood that the market is decide as a little older
space in our finance i would say do integrate some functions
Point i would like to some issues that would like to point
piece of this action with which you believe it is you use a mute
version of the advanced a version of the chip supports lcd displays
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
watch you watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of energy then the shaking
back in thirty minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
talk with our manufacturing department is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion
afraid is not possible to print a picture or the size
