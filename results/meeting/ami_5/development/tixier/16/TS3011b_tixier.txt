device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find the remote control
user interface i come up with And easy remote control and start a beep
power buttons and use one time and the volume
push a button to switch to to channels when you have something and channel four n something on channel switching
method of the remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
easier way of a round button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of that use remote control
important button And there are lots of people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control
decided to implement this a function and can be implemented in in our design
remote going to look not any user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
question of and putting in advanced options
volume because maybe people do not always want to use the voice recognition
stick for volume control and channel selection is the most important function In one button
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv and press that device has to do is to send messages to tv set
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
buttons like that which are easy to use rc is the best one possibility
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound
focusing on younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
advantage is that the circuit board will become much more user if we do in that do not implement
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board
cell phone just one like in the device which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment
tv set would have such a button you would have to walk you tv
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
hands like a turning on and off the light of lightning techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
imagine when you only have a set like to go there and you have about six on the channels imagine
buy personally we should infer use infrared
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness and it can be more trendy in and use design
older you might want to constrain that portion market is interested in some advanced new techniques
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger part is forty percent of the market
thirty time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
fully concentrate on developing a product cost rr in just a part of the equipment
summary of all things are spoken and the different concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
power saving will be a bit more difficult so we can expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
