lots of buttons for the features
economics it's probably better to push buttons would recharge the battery
press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
important features for a remote is seen a menu
depending them a week at a button to switch off in case you get bored
people to be able to use it as a remote control
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu then we can scroll
intrigued by the idea of the scroll buttons to scroll
case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel flipping and then the other white
lcd screen there are on the actual tv and people
concept of the user interface
tend to watch tv i them wanting to say on the tv
chip we can have a simple to shaking around will make it work
main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
shape of a case we could do a flat which flat case the curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
sit there and stand control list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours we could colour
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
member of that this is the device that is going to be useful to people
number of different choices for a design concept and start
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
essential properties of the user interface and we'll come back to the chip
information i have no idea how much more expensive than a regular battery
curve gonna make one curve would just be like a single word looking thing but i have no idea
find a way to protect on the inside
fun doing it components design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
small tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
minute or if you the minutes left of the meeting
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
research has been carried out by real reaction company wind focus on fashion
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
chip-on-print the chip-on-print include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
