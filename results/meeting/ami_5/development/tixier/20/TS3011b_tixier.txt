lots of people complain they kind can find your remote control
unique feature of a remote control and let them buttons
power buttons and use one time and the volume
push a button to switch the channel or to not the volume
method of the remote control is just a function of remote
easier way of a round button what's which can be pushed
user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control
important button And there are lots of people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control
decided to implement this a function and can be implemented in in our design
user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
user interface connect to chip which is connected to the sender which generates
question of and putting in advanced options
elder people do not always want to use the voice
channel selection is the most important function In one button
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
buttons like that which are easy to use we my coat rack
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound
focusing on younger people do not use all the extra features
advantage is that the circuit board will become much more user if we do in that do not implement
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten percent the buttons
sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board
cell phone just one like in the device to incorporates this technique
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment
tv set would have such a button you would have to walk you tv
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light
line in light of lightning techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
imagine when you only have a set like to go there and you have about six on the channels and the old people
buy personally we should infer use infrared
goal was a boston move you would like to start
find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness
older you might want to constrain that portion market is interested in some advanced new techniques
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger part is forty percent of the market
time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
fully concentrate on developing a product cost rr in just a part of the equipment
summary of all things are spoken and the different possibilities
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
disadvantages that there are so concerns about the costs and things like that battery life energy saving another advantage
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem
case we have to metal contacts
