eyes was that the This is for a specific television
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television
user interface for this to be just a bunch of buttons

realistically then we need a product that's got some kind an ft outer casing cheap
nineteen euro is we've got our we've got make a profit
shout your command to it do it for you if it's within what i'm hearing range
update but it anyway so your hand that they require of that it's very hard
