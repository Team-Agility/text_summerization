research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech
people are what it about the shape of the remote control
feed the targets in front of cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
possibility is to download programme information into the lcd screen
button it increases the difficulty of find out a solution
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big difference
application and then shape of the buttons like say the number of buttons
top of the could be a speech recognition
simplest thing the remote to change the channel
produce the tv or we have control of the tv
scroll was actually pretty a pretty wide range of remote controls
industrial designer should work was supposed to work on the components concepts
control to tv only because of time but on the On the chip
cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
tv we can use a tv screen as the screen to feed back to do some feedback informations
press a button to talk and the tvt v set
requirements i'd give it a marketing report is to tv remote court
channel already what's on If you have a list of programmed an lcd screen you just scroll for that program name instead of the channel
extra internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
work and user interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons
imagine also that's the microphone it would be an ambiance and that and then it's microphones
People to use on line which a case of by speak
live in a little in each of the the main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
teletext but we want to get read one of four requirements
seoul extend past the hand shape and it should not be really small
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
master a very easy to use the mouse
map put it in the problem message warm
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
focus more on the internet aspects because you see the text is outdated
electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
bet they may not have pictures but maybe they the there's the penny
selling the potential of the device You'll do we have problems
eds they're more like and they good idea is to it looks like a year
scd e still on this get used to open to discussion
sounds like them and school you know men
average then quincy off by some bottom
