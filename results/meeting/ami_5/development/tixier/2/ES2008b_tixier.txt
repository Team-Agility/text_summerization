sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control
personally what i want from a remote control what we want to do it sends a message
chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared
working designers figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source
appeal to people are only using ten percent of the buttons
designing several different at the types of user interface is critical
parts of the work design they need to be figured
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume
frozen he can show me to pick up the remote
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
control so it's one has got lots of buttons hired
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicate
button on the tv you can press the middle ring
button that allows us to do certain effects on the television
talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
target group that means that is very few we need to each group
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings adjust brightness
combination of electrical energy is converted To port it's practical function
economic we need to find a way of striking a balance
data is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying
battery and that that the chip and convert that much data
instruction manual it comes at the end of the spectrum
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
seventy five percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple
price limit of the twelve and a half euro without having to make too many of a compromise
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
white or thereabouts draw
narrow down to maybe Teenagers and families
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
