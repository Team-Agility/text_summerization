pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour
form of the remote control should be look fancy
decided to have to remotes to the size
button when you get a lcd screen
screen is more advanced than a normal print
table what lcd screen as large as the remote control itself yelling
called like what's the trends from past years what colour shapes colours Material and elderly people
rubber the total piece of rubber
meets more the young people than older people
buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button on the bottom of standbys
screen they don't need that big of cpu
easier to do in colour than a shape
scroll cs or if you have a lot of options
touch options you can't go back
settings menu or just you just wanted to know the volume
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
discussed in the earlier that's all of people don't really want to use these extra settings
fruity colours Innovative all the colleges you blue red and brown
round shapes As soft with the material like the rubber
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
slow you can make a versus the microphone
idea of making it And one single curved
remembered and menu to go back
elderly people just plain old because we decided
option to use as a in a rather simple chip
easy way to a program that you say record
square and round corners put a little in the middle
touchscreen makes it possible to get to go nation of your finger on screen the case
graphical user interface are also some questions about the design
explain some properties of the material
point we already decided that on the previous meeting
chip and we have that's it's possible to scratchy
channel selection for our one of the sixty eight volume we should also be enough for easy
rubber which you can look and feel weird
switch it just from the previous meeting
meeting is once again in thirty minutes of forty
sense that it you ask you give a question so the device into the speaker
normal batteries not like to load
ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition
lose the pen if you lose the pen
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
today i elaborate on the concept
