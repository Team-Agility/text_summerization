people most of teams and people they find that the remote control so for know somewhere in the remote in the home
Seventy five percent of the country where they find too difficult to operate a remote control
find it that was more like in a few watching a fill in the dark you can still see the remote control
remote controls and we should provide close by problem and no suffice to use also so as that they would go there was could easily lead
consumers they're willing to have pay more for speech recognition in terms of the interference and not working
remote control know what's been produced by the television which i'm presuming means is for specific television
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television set that so people
concerned way of What effect be a greater should have on the user interface for this to be just a bunch of buttons
work for a while though because of this noise reference problem they mentioned
setting is really very important point it's if we look at the market those people
speak something of the remote control it applies to something and it glows in the dark
problems of the balloon was are facing the existing remote controls in the market survey on consumers was bound to find
standard interfaces the people other people between twenty five and thirty five where the main and by is of rtv
exist it's not very widely use i don't think easy find a with a whistle functional
important because tft of just released is it at a remote control to the mail in a big
jotted down some notes as to what it needs and what kind a novel features we can add to differentiate our product
buttons and as much point out only ten percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons
button it's hard to tell from here what they're actually do and they really very exciting
remote for to switch the channel and being sent is that they're quite interested in tft display interactive display
idea of And feedback so of remote finder then that kinda
miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and how it fixed
users of data more a tv and then also made it pick up the noise and turn
work with all these product i have a great deal of experience with the industrial designer
in-house so much more market ancient art of how we should design can do other remote controls forty should be there so as to in a house or a sales
reaction turn all yellow strip forty year low skilled in the logo on as bright yellow
noise over certain threshold on a topic up as a distress signal on from you and i'll be back

position alloys that's the bells and whistles we gotta come up with a gimmick but not too complicated
organic shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corner don't feel just as gimmicky
fashion were important so maybe just like little line this around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour
realistically then we need a product that's got some kind an ft outer casing cheap plastic
nineteen euro is we've got our we've got make a profit or our aims
shout your command to it do it for you if it's within what i'm hearing range
update but it anyway so your hand that they require of that it's very hard
decided in the last meeting which were essentially just a lead to have a self connecting break
