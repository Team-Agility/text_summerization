infrared remote control and talking to it but it still need to points to the television
possibility for us to use scroll bar the scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons
scroll wheels i also have some information
hold a remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb So in that case
personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control you just rub on the cover so you're up on the painting
flawless Think about a scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons
case of the volume button and either on the side or the side but do you touch
extra high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
watching a movie and you haven't channel you have chosen like that often the amount of time Any wanted to switch the channel
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
note if you want to use these rubber of the case you must use used by should have pushbuttons
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular
scroll wheel yes the voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
customers specifically ask for the spongy feel you need to to make it buttons all of rubber
work they cannot work with double curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
fronts On which the buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch
colouring is important and soft material but not real spongy
imagine it's a bit like a wave form
talk about all the different components wire in this design of the look and feel The user interface design
traditional devices on this market
suggest we use the sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip i fault
voice recognition you say i were you can program words like volume up Of newt that's a mute
kinetic thing it is it's possibility is more sense of it and you can store
yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours are great and yellow
watch you have the kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it's against the wall
fruit and vegetables are important but innovation is more important than Ease of use for the our target group
discussion the digits six on the bus and it will disappear when it's from rubber
cost rating on the young group like fruit and vegetables In their clothes shoes and furniture
latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cell solution for the energy
simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic cover with the rubber finishing
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar panel and hand dynamo
lcs ids at this is what this is my personal preference but i bet i understood that the market is decide as a little older
space in our finance i would say do integrate some functions
imagine it's very goal to talk to a device with you have two Point i would like to some issues that would like to point
program it you musically you give and And action with which you believe it is you use a mute
version of the advanced a version of the chip supports lcd that's all and we've decided
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
watch you view use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of energy then the shaking
back in thirty minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
talk with our manufacturing department is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion questions
afraid is not possible to print a picture or the size
