added value to the remote control so maybe you can keep it for would be you're not obliged
focus on the go control and just a would be controller fancy controller and the fancy control maybe try to mix
concept to see the however voice control concepts
meet the user requirements i'm just who's sort and then the use of the remote control
find out if it is somewhere in the room if you may be feeding in the table is there you go to say it's triangle one and this is the remote control
time to show was modelling at the play-doh remote control
switching more apart from voice suggest you need to be free without any object you just want to interacts
Technology is the for the immediate were really need to the mexican recognition technology
user is not only interested in having speech recognition system will be able to instead of french
easy to use it's not so important actually with respect
user of compromise that is also the use of the tv and not on the remote control activity
add for a lot of some function of the controller that the functional tv you can retrieve
tv in the dark so if you want to fine you're fine your remote control of these are lost in the dark
receiver to record a gesture of a power always speech and gesturing
ranking all for the points fancy look-and-feel is the most important one and then if we combine
tv and just to recognise gestures and voice of the gesture
overview of what is the fashion in general i have check more than only the remote control
product it is technology has already been developed
small tv simple them to read they're all comparable or without any breaks are in features
comparable to be easy to use that to be said fifty functions so it's a combination
control we need something that's easy which an impression a piece and in addition
present the concept and the user interface would be very cute
team Expert told us most of the people want to use the remote control to zap between channels
price of adding these solar battery would it be something really that will increase the price of prediction
user uses the one who gonna buy the product is works matter percent reliable we do replace it with another man
key it a lot of the key feature of voice recognition mean mobile but you still don't use it to be a mother
language all the time do you think it will work everybody wanting to change channels in the same time
watch or their favourite sent to the programme so this a channel four channel three channel for some of the all the size
Technical as the sun interface designer speak first is to take heed jordan
teed off and kind income for a dv you if you have the control save ten
recognition wall you still have the possibility to use button are a light at the end of the night
work more power on the spongy way to add spongy and touch to the buttons
supplements the Solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add
part of the maybe wood and design
year is that every scene from clothes shoes and furniture is easy inspired by fruits and vegetables
bob and david jordan david was all the buttons and you it sounds good technically
country where you live in the countryside you are far from the cds in some place and instantly are so if you have it at least if you have solar a limitation you just when you want to have a recharger or a remote control or you just put it on the side
similar to what i've said in the previous meeting will start in thirty meeting minutes left Spends
Stick to the first part so what's the difference between that and it's a comparable with other products in the market
show use the design of what the inside at what the inside and out as a different component
point is you were so we do want to have some very cheap Integrated circuits chips or do we have to lower level or very expensive
chip on print so you if you propose lot of all chips would be a and off to have something working
switching from one country cut corners it'd be a problem
find maybe we will close the position
real slice the president
