lots of buttons for all the features
cost we should just go for push buttons which is what real reaction
hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
important features for a remote is seen a menu
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional button to switch off in case you get bored
people to be able to use it as a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
intrigued by the idea of the scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast
case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
scroll through the channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
lcd screen there are on the actual tv and people
concept of the user interface
tend to watch tv i them wanting to say on the tv and the button to switch
regular or advanced chip we can have a simple to shaking around will make it work
bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
shape of a case we could do a flat which flat case the curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery is worse things get most exciting
sit there and stand control list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
buttons could be shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours maybe free vegetable colours
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
intrigued by the idea that these are the options of using the kinetic that you don't have to replace
member of that this is the device going to work together on a model using modelling clay
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
user face we're gonna have to decide the interface and we'll come back to the chip
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
curve gonna make one curve would just be like a single word looking thing but i have no idea
find a way to protect on the inside
fun doing it components design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
small tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
research has been carried out by real reaction company wind focus on fashion in technological elements
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
stressing more talking we then talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
chip-on-print the chip-on-print include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
