pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
material should we used to to make one of those from remote the speech control a lot of people we'll i dropped remote control on a break
miss possible to the g you just put in a row underneath it on the bottom of the remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
small because you have how much nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the lcd screen
printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal print
determine that there will not be no but that's but only an lcd screen as large as the remote control itself yelling
called like what's the trends from past years what people like audience is like a elderly and young people liked about shapes colours Colours
wood rubber the total piece of rubber that's or a that's used to make the case is the same colour so if you scratch
young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
chip on print what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button on the bottom of standbys
screen they don't need that big difference between young people fresh exciting and all people
buy Not faster when they look the same old grey or black the colours will be easier to do in colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
scroll cs or if you have a lot of options appearing on the screen the colour nations but also don't really want to use this this option for mount station
touch options you can't go back
remote control has no way or in the settings menu to look up some some channels on your television use is called a scroll down on a menu which probably does not fit on a screen
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
discussed in the earlier that's all of people don't really want to use these extra settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu
personal preferences for the young people they liked fruity colours like red yellow green blue
hard part of this or soft with the material like the rubber should be soft
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
hand i did single covered the curved remote control
tie That what you'd like to do on the screen is want to go back good morning joe or which made this and this the easy
elderly people like a plain normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
option to use as a in a rather simple chip
easy to have it something like but and minus here the sofa here Minus
find something in the middle ground that square like a week you said is that's easy better or for the elderly people something like that Like the ipod do something with the round corners put a little in the middle
touchscreen makes it possible to get to go nation of your finger on screen the case or or discuss case
graphical user interface are also some questions about the design
explain some properties of the material like wood the titanium
point we already decided that on the previous meeting
colour titanium or you have to pay chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip
menu for button channel selection for our one of the sixty eight volume we should also be enough for easy
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push it in its feels kinda spongy
switch it just from the previous meeting that they should we should use our own business colours
meeting is once again in thirty minutes we have forty minutes to accomplish
sense that it you ask you give a question so the device into the speaker
simple rechargeable batteries not like to load
ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
lose the pen if you lose the pen
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
