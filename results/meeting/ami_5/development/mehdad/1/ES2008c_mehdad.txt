lots of buttons for the features
cost we should just go for push buttons would recharge the battery
hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
important features for a remote is seen a menu
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional button to switch off in case you get bored
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the television be control for your remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
intrigued by the idea of the scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast
case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel
lcd screen there are on the actual tv and people
concept of the user interface list of device
tend to watch tv i them wanting to say on the tv and the button to changing the brightness on trying to see it happening
decided on like a simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip depending
bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
shape of a case we could do a flat which flat case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved case or it maybe even a double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery although there are slight complications with solar battery
point having a television send information back to the remote control list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
buttons could be shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours maybe free vegetable colours
international be on we said but for all age groups different functions to keep the remote from getting lost a large buttons for the essential functions a possibility for extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
intrigued by the idea that these are the options of using the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
work together on a model is a going to be for user interaction with this device that is going to be useful to people
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts panel close
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
essential properties of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface and we'll come back to the chip
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
imagining like double curved is like like two sides that curve gonna make one curve would just be like a single word looking thing but i have no idea
find a way to protect the circuit board
fun doing it components design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
related to this but of latex cases that it's hard to cover with the latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
minute or if you the minutes left of the meeting
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look and feel and as these are range the top one is double important
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these question on the weight of these different elements we can add in the word latex titanium or rubber or other coloured types of plastic
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
reverse it but if we're working this company that i there are what we have to stress fashion watchers in paris and milan comments on some things that are gonna be go on this year
armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
