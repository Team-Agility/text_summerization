shape because it's not like be on the remote control can put in your pocket so i'm not in your jacket
compare with traditional control how to control the scale
light so that it could be channel twenty so you can say channel but if you really want you to do zapping you laundry you want to you kinda and it's just go through all the channel four because you really want to go on this channel
turn off to ten to twelve button to thinking in the tv
comparably to use for these are countries have to put a button and i don't have to push button you have you just turn the to the ball
design it looks like so much room so we call it mushroomed design
Genetically modified much room i was there but I couldn't speak
weak point because with the traditional key traditional controller use button to select the channel
remote maybe if you have five for pushbuttons so we can do this and i'll try to modify
leading the but if you do not but if you go nuts all the brought in all the channel you can that's also a button
