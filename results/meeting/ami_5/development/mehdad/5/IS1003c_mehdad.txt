colour of the the society will be really It will be seen in the remote control or A plastic remote control ever and the were the same one if you have the language
focus on the go control and just a would be controller fancy controller and the fancy control maybe try to mix
concept to see the however voice control concepts
remember as i said last meeting we are really have to be able to fashion remote control market
find out if it is somewhere in the room if you may be feeding in the table is there you go to say it's triangle one and this is the remote control it gives order to the tvc
time to show was modelling at the play-doh remote control
intelligent contra you said that we can use the voice recognition are they just recognition if you have a remote control that like have an object you just want to interacts
Technology is the for the immediate were really need to the mexican recognition technology
user is not only interested in having speech recognition and on just recognition system will be able to instead of french
easy to use it's not so important actually with respect
support you i'm what do we get into that you if you have of what voice control why not to put it back on the tvs speed add to the tv you can retrieve that tv we then you tv be seen that probably function
controller read that cover only a single function if you do not have some function of the controller that the functional tv you can retrieve
tv in the dark so if you want to fine you're fine your remote control of these are lost in the dark
receiver to record a gesture of a power always speech and gesturing
work on be look-and-feel design to have the easy to use board for an fancy remote control with some added value such as the simple vocal commands recognition
tv and just to recognise gestures and voice of the gesture
overview of what is the fashion we want it to be in the remote control market
product it is technology has already been developed
small tv simple them to read they're all comparable or without any breaks are in features
comparable to be easy to use that to be said fifty functions so it's a combination
control we need something that's easy which an impression a piece and in addition
present the concept and the user interface would be very cute
team Expert told us most of the people to have this them and it can be something interesting to make people buy
increase in the private production price of adding these solar battery a regular battery and the sun our initial battery it could be you can increase the price you want out of four euros
user uses the one who gonna buy the product is works matter percent reliable we do replace it with another man
key it a lot of the key feature of voice recognition mean mobile but you still don't use it to be a mother
family watching tv and if we want to use their private remote control in the same time do you think it will work everybody wanting to change channels in the same time
watch or their favourite sent to the programme so this a channel four channel three channel for some of the all the size
Technical as the sun interface designer speak first is to take heed jordan
teed off and kind income for a dv you if you have the control save ten
recognition wall you still have the possibility to use button are a light at the end of the night
work more power on the spongy way to add spongy and touch to the buttons
supplements the Solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add
part of the maybe wood and in wood
year is that every scene from clothes shoes and furniture is easy inspired by fruits and vegetables trends
bob and david jordan david was all the buttons and you it sounds good technically
country where you live in the countryside you are far from the cds in some place and instantly are so if you have it at least if you have solar a limitation you just when you want to have a recharger or a remote control or you just put it on the side
similar to what i've said in the previous meeting will start in thirty meeting minutes left Spends
Stick to the first part so what's the difference between that and it's a comparable with other products in the market
show use the design of what the inside at what the inside and out as a different component
point is you were so we do want to have some very cheap Integrated circuits chips or do we have to lower level or very expensive as the lcd
chip on print so you if you propose lot of all chips would be a and off to have something working
switching from one country cut corners it'd be a problem
find maybe we will close the position
real slice the president
