easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
normal functions the basic function if you are going to use the advanced options are going to press to the menu for the lcd screen
easy so for just a zapping around channels you can just push one button and one navigation button
reduce more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen menu screen it's more about the functions know than the layout
idea because then it becomes clear which buttons to scroll up and down and left or right to go into function
users if we put leave lights on the button menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu in the lcd screen
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option we want to put an lcd screen
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional functionality
Channel up and down and the control of the advanced one but a lot of options for the younger people who are more experience
hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle of it says menu
navigate the channel and left or right for the volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation button
people use mobile phone and also have a screen on top
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
channel settings or channel five and phone account channel anything you want to move the only kind to channel
remote like this if you put it on the top and then make the corporate logo
time to learn how to use a new remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
wary of space left and then put a logo
reach a little bit for the power button but that's present channel
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program is how to seek
corporate identity should be clear in the design of the bus buttons but look how you can push them and like that so the physical aspect
tvs in standby people just press a button and the teacher a goes It it sends a signal to a chip which are translates
spongy else the options are activated based on some so for option that's communicate with the infrared decoder
confirm a want to go one step back to it to upper level which twos and focus
problem mean you are you a car and channel and then it just say is which number do you want to save
visuals of the bride this with that sliding bar and the boss and the like that for sound and then within sounds i trouble on base you need to change
match the operating behaviour of the users are not afraid of a lot of functions or make the buttons as user-friendly
features the above forty people are not so interests and to not interested in the screen and the speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
update for the audience or the target that's a group that one group for the display in one group for the basic functions
channel volume selection so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
irrelevant the less use for audio settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour etcetera
basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
elderly people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television with that usually three buttons and very hard
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
microphone it can be very small phones are just are some stripes a little holes
threw it at transformer it's the signal gets a boost that and then sent to the tv on the tv and that if you will Translated into a function
clear distinction between age groups concerning the features but we just have to build them in because they find
communication if the television it's difficult but that's not hard part you don't have to design
product should reach a new market which is the customers below forty is it from twenty to forty years of thirty
received an email so i'd like we'll use so i'd just drop it in the folder
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work for thirty minute
problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway and lots of the times there is a brand time thinking about what i was gonna do and then a couple minutes before this i get my fun to the information that i need so frustrating
skip that because that's all the news flash and teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
overview of what we discussed in our last Meeting
