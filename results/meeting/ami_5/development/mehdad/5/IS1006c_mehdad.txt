sons speech recognition and it's cheap or a remote control
process i'm thinking about that either part you could argue that the remote control but it seems that's so important but it's used as a remote control
people change tv more often than batteries on their remote controlled every day and or any other to me that you see that the remote control is Is to be something useful that i'm going to talk
simple button and speech recognition technology we take at least five euros or that you put some control we want to reduce
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
back and not to look at a new remote controls it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole
device on that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for do is a finding the tv
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a i'll put that says creaky what they are actions
integrate some into our remote control something like a light kills a lcd screen was different colours
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and batteries for Really like batteries and we will good price
advanced chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive compared to lcd
marriage are all The Brawl the way of saying the thing if we look back
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology inside
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology
location and these people are really interesting on those features or they really like They're more want these fancy features
distinctive look and feel and you look they do Which people use need to the trains if we were in the people want to be different from their friends
Generally add developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface but for Possible instruction or users many all and so all that complex saying so it's come together with your tv and remote controls
straight on these individual action g which are for them ram out a bit design meeting in thirty minutes
flat different colours Depending on what is around like what colours around and depending on the temperature
sixty then you make a lot of money are you don't and you're out of business
simple to program where the chip do we have only the plastic or that cd five or A chip
week about the last year now it has to be spongy
plastic we stick with two batteries solar smart
talk about with their friends mine has this and that euros And finally
interestingly this is the very most important thing it has to be fancy then to be with an that's the second thing you'd have to be it has to be technologically you do the tv
touchpad it just a display for the tv you information
story that for the point before why not the rubber i some rubber parts
ready in the post and down to locate then we have to go for some speaker
propose but the use of solar cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy would solar cells hand too late to just use simple battery
end we find out that it's not feasible in terms of sponginess
bone shape it has to be more wrong than the More roo look natural
blue You use maybe for the addendum Nobody's expense
problem is that this design we phone that we can't use the double record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
criterion the trends that we seen big cities like paris and milan it seems that this year think it should have a fruit and vegetable thing fruit and vegetable and spongy
decision we want to take on this meeting are on the them first and component concept so what energy and the media and the interface for energy
remember has a nokia phone we can use the phone as a good to Example of work to it beeps back
small recap on how do we watch the trends there inventing it You're creating the trend i hope i'm going to try to help you want that this is more risky
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that Mark the user interface design
interface there to use pushbuttons or you could just read it cd display would only be displayed and not a touch sensitive
selling point maybe it has to be the base
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
work together a menu on a prototype using modelling clay
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning joe
puts lots of concentrate
