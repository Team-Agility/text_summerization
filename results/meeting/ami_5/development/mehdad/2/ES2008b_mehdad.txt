sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control are a fairly standard this requirements when the users
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
energy going to the user interfaces controlling the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared
talk about the technical functions design how the apparatus should have and the working designers figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people don't wanna be changing
appeal to people specified problem with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons that they have offered to them on the remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people losing it too if it's the it's a fun
suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different at the types of user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
parts of the work design presentation i have a pet
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design it's gonna be crucial
people are so is that like change the channel and changing the volume people
bothered to pick up the remote all they want like an upgrade
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy into data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us transmitting the data to the receiver
Space is similar to a very basic weapons you have like you have number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
control so it's one has got lots of buttons with essentials
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition was inverse be related to age
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicate like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or adjust
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
fifty percent of the people mention something called rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
talk about our functions and our target group that means that is very few we need to each group
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel settings
team make a schematic of the way that the energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
economic we need to find a way of striking a balance between features and price
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d data is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared bulb which will then bring
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
battery and that that the chip and convert that much data and presents a while without strips gathering
instruction manual it comes at the end of the spectrum
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
seventy five percent of that they would be willing to pay more for a fee and see you're looking remote
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple
price limit of the twelve and a half euro without having to make too many of a compromise
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
Switch the quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
white or thereabouts draw
narrow down to maybe Teenagers and families
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
