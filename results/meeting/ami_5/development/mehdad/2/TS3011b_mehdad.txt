lots of people complain they kind can find your remote control device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find the remote controls
user interface i come up with And easy remote control so we might want to build in the future to support them Some audio signal like one phones
power buttons and use one time and the volume
push a button or switch to to channels when you have something and channel four n something on channel switching
top goal of this meeting is to reach decision on the product on the target group and the functions of the remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote controls the multi function
easier way of a round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button what's which can be press in for directions instead of a stake
user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control Because the user in what state
important button And there are lots of people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control
decided to implement this a function and can be implemented in in our design Perfect design for those only those buttons
functions and the money that we can say from that we should use for having a design and thinking about the user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
user interface connect to chip which is connected to the sender which generates
question of and putting in advanced options
volume because maybe people do not always want to use the voice recognition
channel selection is the most important or volume selection and the teletext
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv and press that device has to do is to send messages to tv set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
save costs by not implementing a lot of function at the functions decide it and our target audience
buttons like that which are easy to use we my coat rack
restriction the characteristics of clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound from other sounds which aren't exactly the same from the point if you all from remote control
focusing on younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
main advantage is that the circuit board will become much more user if we do in that do not implement fancy techniques
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons you have that's the cheaper that the chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten digits but keep the program
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find the finding function
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board
cell phone just one like in the device which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment that's not a moderate
tv set would have such a button you would have to walk you tv is a bus with nancy
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition the data
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lighting and techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
imagine when you only have a set like to go there and you have about six on the channels and the old people
buy personally we should infer use infrared
goal was a boston move you would like to start
find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness and it can be more trendy in and use design
older you might want to constrain that portion market is interested in some advanced new techniques
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger part is forty percent of the market
generates a few times within that a certain period of time to perform are individual work i have no time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product cost rr in just a part of the equipment
summary of all things are spoken and the different concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
disadvantages that there are so concerns about the costs and things like that battery life to the batteries
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
