sense that is the most important thing or four remote controls amusement remotes more controls as good morning remote control on the table or on the couch
hold it you can't all the control and push the buttons
document be sent to the station of the remote control in a recharger
compared to the basic buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons like text easy to put that on the button
pretty standard these rubber buttons are wish there should be on top
Basic remote control are all black and plastic it's that our problem
switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel button above the numbers and switch channel down button
Light switches on if you use a button you knew a lot more like the that meant that and they three player
putting the volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake
modern remote controls the buttons are part of the just it's part of the remote control
find that the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel instead of the current functional look-and-feel so it's very important
numbers should be in the bottom and the switch channel in the middle
shape should be curved So round shapes not nothing square
real reaction logo as on the remote controls so the colours blue red and green blue red so Flashy kinda colours the shape
buttons normal rubber like normal ordinary buttons soft
basic care colour fronts
fancy because of the lights on the bottom that's what difference

spec to the remote control should be easy to know me for a push to the yup
features and then that this is a point said You have to be original in technological innovative big door
decided that we don't to make use of a lcd or speech recognition you need some way many more buttons
recognition We i don't think we should put it on top band that if we gonna put in more technology eugene need to be able to switch to open
drop it you wanna change the volume and top down is more with the channel changing
deciding yellow and it did the top and black on the front
expensive chip We need if we doing if we're doing a display
original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod And and three players mobile phones
divide you have to round it on the button and of skip
date display in the ipod a compared to the basic
display requires an advanced chip can be a simple a regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced
energy source we can use batteries just a rechargeable battery that's cheaper
low if we will a lot of room to put in as logo
strange that i receive an email with a few possibilities on the materials
slide in the docking station
sense for an original look and feel of the case and interface concept
product you by your get one and more basic or you can choose one if you buy the project
kinetic a like but the polls watch so it operates
usability is very important people that want to spend money on something that's similar to a cheaper
target group we talk about was young and trendy
case transparent on the wise the backlight one work together on a prototype drawing a smartboard
show you the And i the the menu to that what's it called
tad next aspect also in contrast to last year the feel of material suspect it is expected to the role on this one at this moment
telephone also have a lcd and that's about two hundred euros
record followed by a question sample and offer a few seconds else or a sample speaker unit is a very small electronic
