complicated but it could increase the popularity of the remote control personality as opposed to a basic
discuss And come to a decision on our remote control are often lost somewhere so those are discuss
controls with dvd vcr that thing would really complicated design of the remote control we've decided not to include them and make it a specific just a specific television function remote controls for older and chi minh devices
compatible with the set I taking inspiration from although similar designed built rank up with a directional trendy remote control which is to send messages to the television sets making a more internationally sellable
eighty percent of user would spend more money when a remote control User say they only use ten percent of the buttons
negate the whole remote control so it should be very user-friendly people can activate the television with their voice and they will be using them they will be talking it remote
array shows time or obtainable as we have less function on the side of things to include in the design of the apparatus is the fact the apparatus
tend to be when you're watching television and saying change Channel and very handy
intention is to stick design we'll have more money t going to the design side
large percentage of the public would pay extra for voice rec voice recognition on the remote control
light up and as which could again could make the company motto on purpose purposes the lighting of thing might be better because the dark colours has a funny colour
constant light up on the remote power thing lights up then it gives the thing close of you have all the lights off in your living room you'll be all temporally
bite for the purposes of this meeting i wasn't offered a like a type of logo what colour so if i could be some more on the design so we can be recognisable
clock you have an lcd screen or a remote control would be that furthering that problem
channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average four times an hour not as much as Channel
end maybe use it would put and that project to the company to do that for as they would be a responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the product to be that when it came cn do this product like if it was heated so everything with spring
Channel changers that a lot of the numbers game rub down if they're printed on the button that you press the menu at the menu
multi function controls can be difficult to use as a lot shape of buttons which we're all familiar with when we using a mobile phone mickey
discussion on what we want This design to look like i have to see some information from the management that will fact some of our decisions so it's out of our hands at this point
sellable just because it's more compatible with our a wider range of television devices it and older generations we should be catering
Applicable to one tv has like information has information on holidays and use show themes like a bart
design thing for now because or try to do so much that if we can make a unique user-friendly that that is also a lot of also on multifunctional we're gonna go over budget
ages like from thirty five to sixty five or shall or number the other twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount that would are willing to spend remote control like their priorities
meets the powerpoint for at this meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of a design
object and find be multifunctional
guest as for my findings looks that one minimise a balance we're not gonna make them actually larger
Receive my emails later on i was too busy carry do it in their mind the reliability of our research
filling out what it for more than what ten at and it's used on average
selling adhesive that you could x to come to the back of any set that would be not very intrusive
product for as long as they felt that they wanted it and then once they contributed then that company can break down the part the parts a party really should be unique design
week me possibly to incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers and cells and be made out of some the dark material
remember from the email we got for a very first kick-off meeting with the coffee machine the functional requirements
cells that but then you'd like a pattern and down button for the channel changing
company could than just use that make use of this shape memory i know it is that they don't need to be manually the be constructed
materials which would just i'm taking the glow during the day in and as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark you put the real reaction some ball at school in the dark and then it would be constantly put rice
trends that are going on in the public even be the who's famous
scrap metal something like the case if it's scratch does anyone wants we use it but you might be able to market with fashionable products
bart simpson face plates end of this to start off with three in if we had a big then we can add
reaching international crowd i know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext option
reach a decision on that right now because we need to investigate the financial implications
figure out what age group we're targeting young adults it looks like something that would pay
final circuit get sides can would call those components is will be how with the wheel actually work on something that could be a lot more durable
'em bits and the basic jobs you can wear out with time all not usable they might be like Bill that's going to scrap metal
press and the alarm from the handset would sound where it was hopefully in the room
raise what's the energy source it could be a battery like rechargeable
