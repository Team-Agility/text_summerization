user's gonna buy an eel control a thing which a user wants to help control more than one device want to control more than one device from the same remote you do need my income for a remote buying
fits in the hand and you had a lot of so phase two The for the control to be the shape of a fruit
lost it things to the remote control that looks like a banana which few buttons with only a few buttons
time more couple of some of the features of that potential funky looking remote control so i was all the idea that we can have to power supply
functionality is just a couple scroll-wheels not button it's hard to get so many button you can say skip i have channels if if i'm going from scrolling possible in united
findings is uses would be really interested in a look at the doing to find out what's it even if it wasn't a recharging station even if they didn't have to buy batteries
hold like the way you the end of the banana it's it's saying like if that seems a bit like an e a few people would really wanna banana
starting is good but you could you should have more the shape of banana you wanna of holders may you may be one of the whole like a gun know and you don't have to point toward the fall
base decision and there is a button if you press the button there are that are more to start beeping this is a way of finding the remote
unaware at this point of the fruit for kids
states for the ease of handling and there's some other issues like we need the book then control what's the sample can directly into pieces
difficult to make it steve like the texture of an hour anyway and take to have exact shape if you'd and not be out the door probably you may as do it in a style as way that just looks a bit more twenty first century route and sixties and seventies
conversation with the coffee machine that that with producing is you can say good morning how would you like a coffee
advanced technology that we can add keywords speech
concentrating on like a fruit or you want to some like fruit but a different fruit for each device
important to have two scroll-wheels because you want one for the channel we also want one for the volume up volume is it's it's very handy for it to have the instant feedback and response
rising is a factor for us that so we'll go for the regular chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana that advanced chip
plastic as a thing is that most appropriate one it'll ring the cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production components
bite the things that by nine that and the base a station is nothing more just it's that by which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket
worth but it doesn't really add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech since the since it's speech not really speech recognition is even if we can do it it's not really appropriate for a television and running
design and you have to work on the user interface
unique problem with television's is that if you have this got this scroll-wheel for the television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll and then just ways that station
basis a extra for the functionality is such as the wheels the speaker you need so that in on the list but the device that may be difficult to can have to build
card application i would presume that it's they wouldn't design of the hand a hundred
norway with with buttons i have to be at some point without worrying too much about how to develop
beep or people are more the devastating never find a fancy look-and-feel instead of a instead of the car and The car and train which was for the functional look and feel down in the technology gonna be know in innovation
received an email i'll and lunchtime they know that the bring in mind to the technology division has developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit
banana you can you hold a top of that we can have solar cells
house and now you don't want the traditional uses we can have the pushbuttons so that they don't feel so old now More more core aspect not more hard core that aspect rather than a devise ways to many phones times on many buttons
importance from leicester more important is that People or nineteen ninety five percent of young people are worse
recognise it can be like a match on on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back the phrase in response
combination just to train it's not the law and channel four hundred channels you have to be a tool to recognise
back to the minutes of the last meeting i like to draw some sketch about the costs future part
spend but charge idea of a banana but without looking completely to forget about the lcd has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out so it's the basic
speaker is actually on the chip then if it's too far away from a the casing was the casing is too thick then you may not hear the the speaker
real recognise i he was but he was in a set not like a freight you train it for a certain for a certain phrase
break so you'd have to worry too much about the case the chip a lot is going to be sitting inside you could have you can still have some cushioning that's not visible to the user
microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big deal
city's would not be possible to implement it for the next prototype is but actually integrated
thin veneer of wood be done in and all those things but plastic you can have the book but the side not the materials we cannot that the book
ripple it's all the ideas we've had we had doing these presentations just to draw some sketch about so which would be the pro the final product and that were strip
decided that we can and spend twenty five euros is that profit
missing israeli fancy and fun and if you teach works we go for the range
additional it will be might be having slightly better market
set it that's a switch with the double curve would actually menu and you could like drawer something on on the whiteboard
