easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
advanced functions the basic functions you normally press to the menu button
easy so for just a zapping around channels you can just push one button
incorporated in the screen menu screen is also more essential
idea because then it becomes clear which buttons to press
leave the menu button menu it or you can incorporate two different buttons
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option
department do we need just the functional functionality of fashionable fashion
advanced a advanced options and functions and buttons is easy
problem with the button in the middle of it says menu
navigate the channels and volume channel up and down screen
people use mobile phones and also have a screen on top
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
channel five on channel settings or channel programming your channels
screen is on top and then make the corporate logo
indy it's the remote control on noticed in your room
wary of space left and then put a logo
reach a little bit for the power button if you grab
harder to if you have already program it to swap
corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote
pressing up and down you can easily press the channel
extra options are activated based on some so for options
step back to it to upper level which twos and focus
select a number in a remote and which want to save
tv options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble on base
marketing research stated that users are not afraid of a lot of functions
integrate the screen speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
functions and on the Seems was it the target group below forty
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour
basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
people don't understand it so so they need a simpler remote
working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
mobile phones are just are some stripes a little holes
signal of certain spatial frequencies it's a counters one it shows on your tv
features are hidden in the screen with the clear menu
difficult but that's not hard part you don't have to design
sixteen to forty is it from twenty to forty years of thirty
state of the save automatically in the project folder the teletext
lunch break and then we can work for thirty minutes
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information
news flash also stated that so it should control only one device only your television
