pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
important thing people like to last year was that the remote control
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons
blc d screen is more advanced than a normal print
main you can fit the lcd screen it's quite innovative
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes colours Material
rubber the total piece of rubber is still the rubber isn't fancy
young people can see it because it is the unique
buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button
screen they don't need that big difference between young people fresh exciting and all people
colours will be easier to do in colour physical forward
larger it's not really on scale then to work an option
touch options you can't go back
settings menu to look up some some channels on your television
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
called cults settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu
young people they liked fruity colours like red white yellow
hard part of this or softer rubber should be soft
navigate through menu great with the scroll up next to the remote isn't that handy
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
remembered and menu to go back it's a big button go back
people like a plain normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
option to use as a in a rather simple chip
easy to have it something like but and minus here the sofa here Minus
square shape sit around got on the round corners what's square
cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
graphical user interface are also some questions about the design
explain some properties of the material
point we already decided that on the previous meeting
colour titanium or you have to pay chip and we have that's it's possible to scratchy
menu for button channel volume we should also be enough for easy
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
meeting that they should we should use our own business colours
time we have forty minutes or thirty minutes of forty
sense that it you ask you give a question so the device
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
