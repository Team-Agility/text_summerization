remote control becomes a green if you press a button and it doesn't work
beautiful remote control eight percent use would spend more money when a remote controls
shopping is cr or a tv control especially when you only have tv function
reading on a page remote control just sends come on space six months to to television
points we had last meeting was should be you universal Remote control
telephone i never use those buttons to call your remote control beeps mean like that button on stage
room so we have to understand what buttons are used to to make it universal
special all the plo eight people might be bigger buttons
closing that certain circuit gets close by pressing the button the like a switch
switched off you can push a button you push so you see green
missed did i miss any other buttons those buttons
stripes so you have like at five seconds period to press those two buttons
lose about ninety percent of those options of teletext option Maybe we have to skip
normal be put in the simple is to use to send the standards features
random people more often used the internet and elderly people what they use what they want on remote control
point is if we made make remote control for only television it's hard to sell it for twenty five euros
divide between functions you often used like maybe switch channels and volume and that things and the menu button
full like your it's already said only ten percent on the top ten year
find out what people use maybe just use questionnaires on the internet
hard to remember if i press that button it goes to that channel connects to what favourite
people of interest of this company are forty plus people in or a nature for forty five for more interested in new features
banana what are the most things in modern tvs are also on the menu
computer it's on your television dvd players t real and vcr had a question
functions like numbers only numbers for the more nothing but only the numbers want to twenty
buttons the design is most important you can do integrate that volume and previous
fits at the what time if you set about the older people will spend more money
screen green a red button to go to the next one or two ago could prove
invisible and this one's producing normal one also a normal light not led light
lights emitting diode is producing infrared light this invisible
receptor in the tv senses that's room
configuring the spectrum just chip is trying to switch off the television
fallen off to take the efforts to design something with the speech recognition directly
hard to realise that we have short time to put it on the market
required because it like in a mobile phone in the dark
moral on you you type search and to do that began
sixty five persons the city of persons of the users said they zap
circuit as close to produce is the pattern Like a morse code
work them and does it have to work only in english or in dutch
optional like we discussed like ipod different colours you can choose blue or yellow
forty minutes for this for the second meeting so show the show
main thing is the usability that's when we can make it a special product or own style
marketing report from other side
