pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
important thing people like to last year was that the remote the speech control
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
small because you have how much nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the lcd screen
printer enough llc d screen if you make screen for called as matter
main you can fit the lcd screen as large as the remote control itself yelling
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly people
wood rubber rubber that makes it easy to to tune that's it's of colour
young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button
screen they don't need that big difference between young people fresh exciting and all people
entire thing in the corporate colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
larger it's not really on scale then to work an option for mount station
touch options you can't go back
remote control has no way or in the settings menu to look up some some channels on your television
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
options is the settings of the remote enough to tv and that a thing called cults settings
young people they liked fruity colours like reading brown light out dark red yellow
hard part of this or softer rubber is the best suits poll up material
navigate through menu great with the scroll up next to the remote isn't that handy
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
tie That what you'd like to do on the screen is want to go back
elderly people like a plain normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
option to use as a in a rather simple chip
easy to have it something like but and minus here the sofa here Minus
shapes it is something between the square shape sit around got on the round corners what's square
chip on print think cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
noticed that be in this file design or the user interface and the buttons
explain some properties of the material
point we already decided that on the previous meeting
colour titanium or you have to pay chip and we have that's it's possible to scratchy
Channel selection for our one of the sixty eight volume we should also be enough for easy
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
overheard to the last meeting that they should we should use our own business colours
lasting not not be anti it's a two minutes or thirty minutes of forty
sense that it you ask you give a question so the device into the speaker
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
bigger for microphone for the speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
agenda the base five presentation is once again or at least an agenda
edit issue to remove degrees
