people are very frustrated with their remote controls do you mean that makes sense
Speakers in the remote control that's ask people who are users of remote controls
focusing on tv but you that we talk about the universe so the remote control
control so you wouldn't have to that type in your buttons in these remote controls
functions that made be use but you do use or in the Current remote controls
targeting the what who are we targeting with these remote control he for targeting
controls or we can have more functions for tv or vcr or dvd player et cetera
People that want to have a power button channel
show you some of the results we found one be survey about the weather people would like are not to have this of function meeting their remote control
da main chip which controls or volume and these buttons and this tsb's
phones some of the phones have some of these so functionality phone that you can phone your phone
aim at a young a very old people this is something do you read
back before a specific instruction what was saying to you by your personal settings
menu which can be controlled with the left right up down and cover
generate some information to the main device to do particular operations and the total
function easy it is being could be instead off using the buttons should be easy to find them too quick
hundreds of channels they want to zap a lot of the one hundred channels
buttons we need is on off volume or a tree be something like volume
ds to hide the device and they all the early adopters of the new device our young people
case between one and then the relevant it seems that people find teletext they're relevant
technical functions but more user interface and kinda intentions and I was an adjustment
focusing on all work and a place to waste actual remote control we need feel
people really need to go to channel number twenty five and ten to sixty
volume is not really speech recognition and also marketing export phone that speech recognition least really handy
tvs will have different encryption court for blinks research on a chain
infrared led source which sends the information to the main device
control so we should pretty spend lots of time and effort
project manager Ask me to do some presentation about technical functions design the king
voice like it can turn on the lights For you just to find it as a light
Simple design isn't a simple actions but to be universal
propose this concept for a design just few buttons the screen was the backlight which can change colours
tape all around you can have some speech recogniser on or ds be cheap
mysterious these key buttons can be transformed into some miss a day
people do that so like to turn on with clapping
feel what's like paul or switch on or some lake
focused on the Individual actions but not on the components we can incorporate
distance and the angle maybe if you have a six euros fifty
keys are increase or we played only recognised or sports
big and reportedly sends some information to be She played in some form like more lemon trees or like this keating
miss a day and then you to process but be cheap and they need to generate
remember what is there a site It's for kids the tvt stress injury
front page because it i spent a lot of time doing this presentation
task is not to forget about the welcome razor
display on numbers and then they can display is supposed to fly d displays born
normal battery so this battery one ceases to see jonah it to tape
