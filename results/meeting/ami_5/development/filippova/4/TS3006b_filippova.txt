easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
advanced functions the basic functions you normally press to the menu for the lcd screen
easy so for just a zapping around channels you can just push one button
screen is all the configuration options you can put that on the screen functions
clear which buttons to scroll up and down and left or right to go into function
button menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional requirements
pretty handy for advanced a advanced one but a lot of options and functions
longer so that you can put your from also reach the middle of it says menu
channels and left or right for the volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons
people use mobile phones and also have a screen on top
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
channel five on channel settings or channel programming your channels in the right order
screen is here then the logo should be like on top on the side
indy it's the remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
wary of space left and then put a logo
reach a little bit for the power button but that's present channel
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program the channels
remote and that you can choose what the design of the bus buttons but look how you can push them and like that so the physical aspect
pressing up and down you can easily press the when she when you're not already at your choice
larger public we have more options are activated based on some so for options
confirm a want to go one step back to it to upper level the finally
week or on the channel number in a remote and which want to save
tv options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble on base
match the operating behaviour of the users are not afraid of a lot of functions
integrate the screen speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
functions and on the Seems was it the target group so it's above forty
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
irrelevant the less use for audio settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour
basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television with that usually three buttons and very hard
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
microphone it can be very small phones are just are some stripes a little holes
signal of certain spatial frequencies it's a counters one it shows on your tv
simple and all that advanced features are hidden in the screen with the clear menu
communication if the television it's difficult but that's not hard part you don't have to design
skip this price as because i read a ball forty is it from twenty to forty
state of the save automatically display the name which you get to the cable
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information
news flash also stated that so it should control only one device only your television
overview of what we discussed in our last Meeting
