companies that thing that they show them what are more functions of the users in their remote controls
loss and means therefore that they have kept in remote control last time Where do we add
remote control by the tv speaker and transmitter there it sends back to remote
technical know let's do see at the mall how to operate these remote control
feature which which is brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection future for when you lose your remote like people
Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote control so available in the market
losing the remote in trying to find the finer things it's could probably make a circuit diagram
build spacecraft you'll have no problem and no suffice to use also so as that they would go there was could easily lead
remote control they cannot to use go they had a some basic speech recognition and whistling
remote it's only for the television which i'm presuming means is for specific television
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television set that so people
concerned way of What effect be a greater should have on the user interface
work for a while though because of this noise reference problem they mentioned
setting is really very important point it's if we look at the market those people
speak something of the remote control it applies to something and it glows in the dark as a gimmick essentially
problems of the balloon was are facing the existing remote controls in the market a detailed
information to rise cases was very useful but what people fashionable because we said people
exist it's not very widely use i don't think easy find a with a whistle functional
important because tft of just released is it at a remote control for presentations so and a big
jotted down some notes as to what it needs and what kind a novel features we can add to differentiate our product
telephone that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons
user interface problem too many buttons and if you hit that menu the top
bbc too and bbc one or switch the channel or to turn the tv
idea of And feedback so of remote finder then that kinda
miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and how it fixed
watching the tv and then also made it pick up the noise and turn
personally worked with all these products i have a great deal of experience with the industrial designer
house or say that in this a day in this part or age group from fifteen to thirty
paid yellow strip forty year low skilled in the logo on as bright yellow
noise over certain threshold if you had a like a movie on your likely get it beeping back
logo and so the slogan we put fashion in electronics so we as the company we want to make a product trendy in fashions a big concern
low tech and not too many buttons set appeal on to consideration when i was a profit sense
chance to the tft or the lcd thing is if you're also wanting
materials cheap but it's just the go on the dark your needs some like a charger
people would require and teletext in a remote teletext because it's become outdated everybody uses the internet
bells and whistles that we mentioned it take more budgeting more technical expenditure of effort
organic get more organic shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corners
colours and fashion were important so maybe just like little line this around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour
realistically then we need a product that's got some kind an ft outer casing cheap plastic
nineteen euro is we've got our we've got make a profit or our aims
shout your command to it do it for you if it's within what i'm hearing range
update but it anyway so your hand that they require of that it's very hard
base station so essentially that we had decided in the last meeting and then we ended
opposed to with batteries we don't need to provide all we pride fast batteries but it's more it's that's cheaper to justify battery
