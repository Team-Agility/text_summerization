easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
advanced functions the basic functions you normally press to the menu button
easy so for just a zapping around channels you can just push one button
costs of customise the screen menu screen is to reduce the size
clear which buttons to scroll up and down and left or right to go into function
leave the menu button menu it or you can incorporate two different buttons
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional requirements
advanced a advanced options for the younger people who are more experience
time you have one button in the middle of it says menu
power button and channel and volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons
people use mobile phones and also have a screen on top
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
channel five on channel settings or channel programming your channels in the right order
screen is here then the logo should be like on top of sweet
lower age groups a design it's it doesn't make a remote control
wary of space left and then put a logo
reach a little bit for the power button but that's present channel
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program the channels
remote and that you can choose what the design and the actual design
figure or figure out a way to do that easily press the channel
spongy else the options are activated based on some so for options
confirm a want to go one step back to it to upper level the finally
week or on the channel number in a remote and which want to save
tv options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble on base

functions and on the Seems was it the target group below forty
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour etcetera
basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
elderly people don't understand it so so they need a simpler remote
working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
annoying most small phones are just are some stripes a little holes
signal of certain spatial frequencies it's a counters one it shows on your tv
simple and all that advanced features are hidden in the screen with the clear menu
communication if the television it's difficult but that's not hard part you don't have to design
sixteen to forty is it from twenty to forty years of thirty
state of the save automatically display the name which you get to the cable
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information
news flash also stated that so it should control only one device only your television
