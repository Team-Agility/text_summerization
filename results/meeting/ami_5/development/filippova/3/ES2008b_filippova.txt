remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control
personally what i want from a remote control is a device that simple
energy going to the user interfaces controlling the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared
technical functions presentation working design how the apparatus can fulfil its function
designed to like this you have your energy source people don't wanna be changing
people maybe people who have problems with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
designing the user interface the user interface concept market trend were watching
easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task a step
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume
money to buy a new remote all they want like an upgrade
components that we find here are the energy or information to the chip
weapons you have like you have numbers to get a different ideas
wind One large accessible buttons could be yellow but we can play
older people didn't really care for voice recognition but at the price
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicated
button on the tv that's just impossible to use or maybe broke
control in this index opinions on the television remote controls in the analysing
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find specific target group
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings adjust brightness
converts electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
find out find a balance between features and price as you mentioned
work or infrared bulb which will then bring the data to the receiver
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
instruction manual it comes at the end that's and hot because of the combination
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple
price limit of the twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
time you get specific in crap instructions from your personal coach emailed
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
white or thereabouts draw
narrow down to maybe Teenagers and families
