people are very frustrated with their remote controls do you mean that makes sense
Speakers in the remote control that's ask people who are users of remote controls
focusing on tv but you that we talk about the universe so the remote control
simplest one as long as they are the i find the buttons
find it very ugly Current available remote controls are not so easy
targeting the what who are we targeting with these remote control he for targeting
controls or we can have more functions for tv or vcr or dvd player et cetera
People that want to have a power button channel
survey on the use of the remote controls and i'd like to show
main chip which controls or volume and these buttons and this tsb's
phones some of the phones have some of these so functionality phone that you can phone your phone
aim at a young people read do we like to see zap
control we would have each one and that was our own personal settings
menu which can be controlled with the left right up down and cover
encryption that it's pricing information to the main head and device that tv
function easy it is being could be instead off using the buttons should be easy to find them too quick
hundreds of channels they want to zap a lot of the one hundred channels
buttons we need is on off volume or a tree be something like volume
ds to hide the device and they all the early adopters of the new device our young people
case between one and then the relevant it seems that people find teletext they're relevant
dui d you mark will be focused on the user interface concept
focusing on all work and a place to waste actual remote control
people really need to go to channel number twenty five and ten to sixty
scenes or User interface In to sustain speech recognition in a remote control
tvs will have different encryption court for blinks research on a chain
infrared led source which sends the information to the main device
control so we should pretty spend lots of time and effort
project manager Ask me to do some presentation about technical functions design
voice like it can turn on the lights For you just to find it as a light
Simple design isn't a simple actions but to be universal
propose this concept for a design just few buttons the screen was the backlight which can change colours
simple speech recogniser then or generally smaller reduce the signal crossing cheap
mysterious these key buttons can be transformed into some miss a day
people do that so like to turn on with clapping
feel what's like paul or switch on or some lake
wheels focus on the components maybe the energy source like the back
distance and the angle maybe if you have a six euros fifty
keys are increase or we played only recognised or sports
big and reportedly sends some information to be She played in some form like more lemon trees or like this keating
miss a day and then you to process but be cheap and they need to generate
remember what is there a site It's for kids the tvt stress injury
front page because it i spent a lot of time doing this presentation
task is not to forget about the welcome razor
display on numbers and then they can display is supposed to fly d displays born
normal battery so this battery one ceases to see jonah it to tape
