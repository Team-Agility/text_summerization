lots of buttons for the features
cost we should just go for push buttons but i'm it intrigued
press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
important features for a remote is seen a menu
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu then we can scroll
thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll an actual i got ipods scroll button
case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
buttons to select your favourite channels and the channel flipping and then the other white
lcd screen there are on the actual tv and people
concepts of user interface
watching tv in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons
simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip
main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case it can have any titanium
lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
sit there and stand control the television and be controlled through the device
advantages and disadvantages if you have an lcd display would have to be quite small
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
shaped like a vegetable or like i don't like a carrot source
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
idea of the kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches
essentially we need to choose how is this device going to work
switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
covered with the latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
user interface we have to decide on whether i have a scroll
information on cost other than it's more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
double curved like would that be like two hands time i am imagining
find a way to protect like the chip
conceptual design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
small tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
fickle a or latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
research has been carried out by real reaction company wind focus on fashion in technological elements
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
fashion and simplicity and easy to use is necessarily the right drinking personally
armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
