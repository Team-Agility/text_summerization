pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
recognise does the remote the speech control concepts
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons
blc d screen i how much the actual remote
work with the lcd screen was a rather small
called like what's the trends from past years
rubber rubber is still the rubber isn't fancy
meets more the young people than older people
buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button
screen they don't need that big difference between young
colours will be easier to do in colour
larger it's not really on scale then to work an option
touch options you can't go back
settings menu to look up some some channels on your television
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
called cults settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu
young people they liked fruity colours like red yellow
hard part of this or softer rubber should be soft
navigate through menu great with the scroll up next to the remote isn't that handy
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
remembered and menu to go back from the floor
people like a plain normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
option to use as a in a rather simple chip
easy way to a program that you say record
square shape sit around got on the round corners what's square
cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
user interface are also some questions about the design
explain some properties of the material
point we already decided that on the previous meeting
colour titanium or you have to pay chip
volume we should also be enough for easy
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
conceptual design meeting placed inside our project folder
time we have forty minutes or thirty minutes of forty
sense that it you ask you give a question so the device
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
question and three seconds later you say the answer
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
prepared a little presentation will we on your side
edit issue to remove degrees
bike little rr and r and rr on the top
