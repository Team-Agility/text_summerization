people are very frustrated with their remote controls
remote control that's ask people who are users of remote controls
focusing on tv but you that we talk about the universe so the remote control
buttons are they need to give it a menu button
easy to use and it did the Current remote controls
target a user personalised a remote control he for targeting
controls or we can have more functions for tv
People that want to have a power button
show you some of the results we found one be survey
main chip which controls or volume and these buttons and this tsb's
phones some of the phones have some of these so functionality phone that you can phone your phone
aim at a young people use these big
control we would have each one and that was our own personal settings
market expert some again show up on that trend watching
encryption that it's pricing information to the main device
buttons should be easy to find them too quick
easy to go just next we have hundreds of channels
volume or a tree be something like volume
ds to hide the device like air conditioning
relevant it seems that people find teletext they're relevant
user interface and kinda intentions and I was an adjustment

scenes or User interface In to sustain speech recognition
control and pointed to the tv for the moment
source which sends the information to the main device
control so we should pretty spend lots of time and effort

voice like it can turn on the lights For you just to find it as a light
Simple design isn't a simple actions but to be universal
screen was the backlight which can change colours
simple speech recogniser on or ds be cheap
mysterious these key buttons can be transformed into some miss a day
automatic on off is also a big problem idea
time you need to switch on or switch
wheels focus on the components we can incorporate
target is only like four point five euros
increase or we played only recognised or sports
big and reportedly sends some information to be She played in some form like more lemon trees or like this keating
miss a day and then you to process but be cheap and they need to generate
remember what is there a site It's for kids
front page because it i spent a lot of time doing this presentation
