users using a remote their own remote controls all subjective
personally what i want from a remote control is a device that simple
chip which is also controlled by the user
technical functions design how the apparatus can fulfil its function
designed to like this you have your energy source people
lots of buttons and that might be older people
chip that works with the user interface is critical
parts of the working design presentation i have a pet
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume
button them i'm gonna buy a new remote
careful that doesn't impede it the chip transmitting information
weapons you have like you have numbers and sports colours
large buttons could be yellow but we can play
older people didn't really care for voice recognition
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicated
tv that's just impossible to use or maybe broke
sends a message to the television and the power
talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
clear idea of an lcd screen was brought
fifty percent of the people mention that was the biggest frustration
talk about our functions and our target group
simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings adjust brightness
converts electrical energy is converted To port it's practical function
find out find a balance between features and price
bring the data to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
battery and that that the chip takes the data
coffee at the end user is gonna want from this product
Sit simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics
number to make it technologically the end of select
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease
price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
Switch the quality a quality of the chair
time you'll be able to access more of the website
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
white or thereabouts draw
narrow down to maybe Teenagers and families
