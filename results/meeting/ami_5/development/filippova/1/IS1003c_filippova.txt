microphone sitting there is a remote control user
controller and the fancy control is very attractive
concept to see the however voice control concepts
meet the user requirements i'm just who's sort and then the use of the remote control
find maybe a shape for the wooden remote control
time to show was modelling at the play-doh remote control
voice recognition then just recognition if you have a remote control
point is this d wanted it to be technologically innovative
speech recognition and on just recognition is also worry
easy to use it's not so important actually with respect
image on the tv and you don't need a remote controller
add for a lot of some function of the controller that the functional
tv in the darkness so if you want to fine you're fine your remote control of these are lost in the dark
develop a remote control always speech and gesturing
meeting user really we want a fancy look-and-feel
tv and just to recognise gestures and voice
general fashion we want it to be in the remote control
product it is technology has already been developed
design you comparable or without any breaks are in features
combination of easy to use and the fifty functions
control we need something that's easy vote to remember
concepts and the user interface would be very cute
marketing studies asking people want to have a spongy touch
price of adding these solar battery would it be something really that will increase the price
reliable but it's a feature to distinguish our product
features we can attract a lot of user
time do you think it will work everybody wanting to change channels in the same time
watch or their favourite sent to the programme so this a channel control
user interface and just interface then use button
income for a dv you if you have the control save ten
buttons i prefer as a as cd collected buttons
work more power on the spongy way to add spongy and touch to the buttons
mix them is to concerts together just in one Do the remote control with solar energy
fit with the wood and design
fruits and but it vegetables and the other point
jordan you'll have to work together on the prototype
cd we don't have to do some basic research on this field
meeting will start in thirty meeting minutes left Spends
big difference between that and it's a comparable
show you some picture of what the inside
touch screen We'll be as expensive as the lcd
chip on print so you if you propose lot of all chips would be a and off to have something working
switching from one country cut corners it'd be a problem
find maybe we will close the position
real slice the president
