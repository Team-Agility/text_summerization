microphone sitting there is a remote control it you can send these can use remote control
channel control easy to use sophisticated and fancy controller and the fancy control maybe try to mix
concept to see the however voice control concepts
meet the user requirements i'm just who's sort and then the use of the remote control
find maybe a shape for the wooden wouldn't be wooden remote control it gives order to the tvc
time to show was modelling at the play-doh remote control
voice recognition then just recognition if you have a remote control that like have an object
Technology is the for the immediate were really need to the mexican recognition technology
related to what you said was the speech or just to recognition and on just recognition
easy to use it's not so important actually with respect
user of compromise that is also the use of the tv and not on the remote controller
add for a lot of some function of the controller that the functional tv you can retrieve
tv in the darkness so if you want to fine you're fine your remote control of these are lost in the dark
develop a remote control always speech and gesturing
ranking all for the points fancy look-and-feel is the most important one and then if we combine
tv and just to recognise gestures and voice of the gesture
combine this with the fashion in general i have checked more than only the remote control
product it is technology has already been developed
small tv simple them to read they're all comparable or without any breaks are in features
comparable to be easy to use that to be said fifty functions so it's a combination
control we need something that's easy which an impression a piece and in addition
present the concept of user interface would be very cute
point i haven't mentioned these people want to use the remote control to zap between channels
price of adding these solar battery would it be something really that will increase the price
user uses the one who gonna buy the product is works matter percent reliable we do replace it with another man
features of our corporate site as you have the feature a file control and that he's it has some but that keychain
time do you think it will work everybody wanting to change channels in the same time
watch or their favourite sent to the programme so this a channel four channel three channel for some of the all the size
Technical as the sun interface designer speak first is to take heed jordan
teed off and kind income for a dv you if you have the control save ten
recognition wall you still have the possibility to use buttons i prefer as a as cd collected buttons
work more power on the spongy way to add spongy and touch to the buttons
mix them is to concerts together just in one Do the remote control with solar energy
fit with the wood and design
year is that every scene from clothes shoes and furniture is easy inspired by fruits and vegetables
bob and david jordan david was all the buttons and you it sounds good technically
country where you live in the countryside you are far from the cds in some place and instantly are so if you have it at least if you have solar a limitation you just when you want to have a recharger or a remote control or you just put it on the side
similar to what i've said in the previous meeting will start in thirty meeting minutes left Spends
Stick to the first part so what's the difference between our comparable with other products in the market
show use the design of what the inside at what the inside and out as a different component
point is you were so we do want to have some very cheap Integrated circuits chips or do we have to lower level or very expensive
chip on print so you if you propose lot of all chips would be a and off to have something working
switching from one country cut corners it'd be a problem
find maybe we will close the position
real slice the president
