lots of buttons for the features
cost we should just go for push buttons which is what real reaction
press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
important features for a remote is seen a menu
depending them a week at a buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control could double
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu then we can scroll
thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast
case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
buttons for your favourite channel changing the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
lcd screen there are on the actual tv and people
concepts of user interface
time when you're watching tv in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons
decided on like a simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip depending
bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main ones being like and lemons or stripe
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case it can have any titanium
ri uses for buttons to me to move around so range of settings so on a small lcd screen
solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
television send information back to the remote control list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display would have to be quite small
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
changeable covers like for your mobile in different fruit and vegetable or like i don't like a carrot source
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
idea of the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
member of that this is the device going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay
switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
user face we're gonna have to decide the interface and we'll come back to the chip
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
curve gonna make one curve would just be like a single word looking thing but i have no idea
find a way to protect like the chip
minimalist taken this design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
small tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
hit my understanding of old latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
research has been carried out by real reaction company wind focus on fashion in technological elements
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
