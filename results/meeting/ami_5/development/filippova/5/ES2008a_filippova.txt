remotes ten to have buttons and you have to pass to actually turn on the tv
remote that has the main function of the on off channel changing volume and at the right remote with all the special
creating a new remote control which we have three goals about it needs to be original
industrial designer on this project
hour now we keep combining all the remotes can together versus having if by different remotes
individual work and a meeting
watching tv i have a we separate remote controls of in front of me and one for the tv one for the digital box one for the video recorder
stick to having television on the top it simpler to show us buttons
normal the to the project it could have like to you by your experiences using rubber remote controls
tv that you have to do one for the power the tv
play in the court and stop buttons that you need to programme the video recorder
working on this one for about twenty so we continue
user interface designer that's real that's Technical functions i like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons on the user requirements
programmed into it's all just in a separate place and not like all the on button see a doctor
continue discussing more new ideas
define this up in the three compact three parts first the functional design
street moving it around to get it to work together to achieve
define what or aiming for if it's just a television
residence right now the television you should have to walk all around the room together to turn on so it's just simple
leave and technically be possible to include video recorder or programme it's other things that i'm not a coherent
save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would need to use every day
discussing and the next meeting
remotes together and then on off a necessarily like that if like to end up to multimedia overload it just wanna watch
rose and then i'll be the project manager From california
tv on that note that happen on the remote a number of a beep or a corporate so now in terms of how we're gonna make it but if it's like all the tv set
sounds like we've had a good little session for our first ideas mind if we move

bob of into a quaint and so just going to know each other little bit including a tool training exercise a normal
opening and then i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project bob of into a quaint
older people or people like me that are fake court needed hand i it's really quite important that you're not pressing a small teeny mobile phones size buttons
television at the with the market range of the internet like it's in international market range we do have to worry
sell it for about twenty five euro with a profit aim of fifty million euro So we're selling
pretty neat little tools
user requirements so do we hearing about different runs how about different things that people
specific instructions sent by your personal coach i realised in this past
lazy like mean the print outs
