lots of people complain they kind can find your remote control it's very easy to change the channel
user interface i come up with And easy remote control and the advanced remote controls and let them buttons
power buttons and use one time and the volume
channel nineteen you only have that button or change the channel or to not the volume
remote controls the multi function of remote control is to send messages to the television set
easier way of a round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button
user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control Because the user
important thing for people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control
multi function and can be implemented in in our design Perfect design we should really implement
remote going to look not any user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
buttons for the advanced options
volume because maybe people do not always want to use the voice recognition
relevance scale the channel selection you have them to most important or volume and programme selecting
device can have communicate with almost every tv set starts to make a weights out and your remote
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet is replacing teletext
function if it's possible within the costs by not implementing a lot of functions then they mikes
buttons like that which are easy to use rc is the best one possibility
idea to think about these buttons trendy design lightning what and the sound from other sounds
numbers about the speech recognition here that's younger people do not use all the extra features
advantage is that the circuit board will become much more user if we do in that do not implement
fewer buttons you have that's the cheaper that the chip or in one of the circuit board
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find the one solution
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board
list of functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all functions available device that size and all the buttons
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment that's not a moderate
base station next a tv set would have such a button you would have to walk you tv
problem is it but it depends on the decisions disease up in this since it's the best and makes about the voice recognition
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
money we say if we using this we can use for an average fancy lightning techniques blinking lights
imagine when you only have a set like to go there and you have about six on the channels imagine
buy personally we should infer use infrared
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness and it can be more trendy in and use design
older you might want to constrain that portion market is interested in some advanced new techniques
specially designs and energy friendly components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger parts off the market isn't the forty percent we Want to sell
generates a few times within that a certain period of time to perform are individual work
products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
dark concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
power saving will be a bit more difficult so we can expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
