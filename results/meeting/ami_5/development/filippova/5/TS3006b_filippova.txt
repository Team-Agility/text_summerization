easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
advanced functions the basic options are going to press to the menu for the lcd screen
easy so for just a zapping around channels you can just push one button and one navigation button
screen it's more about the functions are are going to to be on the screen menu
clear which buttons to scroll up and down and left or right to go into function
Menu button menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional requirements
simple functions for the whole public and the advanced options for the younger people who are more experience
longer so that you can put your from also reach the middle of it says menu
navigate the channels and left or right for the volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons
people use mobile phones and also have a screen on top
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
channel five and phone account channel anything you want to move the only kind to channel
remote like this if you put it on the top and then make the corporate logo
lower age groups a design it's it doesn't make a remote control on noticed in your room
wary of space left and then put a logo
reach a little bit for the power button but that's present channel
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program is how to seek
remote and that you can choose what the design of the bus buttons but look how you can push them and like that so the physical aspect
pressing up and down you can easily press the when she when you're not already at your choice
extra options are activated based on some so for options that's communicate with the infrared decoder
confirm a want to go one step back to it to upper level which twos and focus
problem mean you are you a car and channel number in a remote and which want to save
tv options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble on base
marketing research stated that users are not afraid of a lot of functions or make the buttons as user-friendly
integrate the screen or speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
functions and on the Seems was it the target that's a group so it's above forty
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
irrelevant the less use for audio settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour
basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television with that usually three buttons and very hard
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
microphone it can be very small phones are just are some stripes a little holes
signal of certain spatial frequencies it's a counters one it shows on your tv and so your remote
clear distinction between age groups concerning the features but we just have to build them in because they find
communication if the television it's difficult but that's not hard part you don't have to design
skip this price as because i read a ball forty is it from twenty to forty
received an email so i'd like we'll use so i'd just drop it in the folder
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information that i need so frustrating
news flash and teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
overview of what we discussed in our last Meeting
