remember that remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control
personally what i want from a remote control is a device which is fairly conventional in design
energy going to the user interfaces controlling the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared
technical functions presentation working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people
people maybe people who have problems with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
industrial design if you're components concept user interface the user interface concept market trend were watching
easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task a step
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
big buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the volume changing the channel
frozen he can show me to pick up the remote all they want like an upgrade
careful that doesn't impede it the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy or information
weapons you have like you have numbers but you before the next meeting in terms of users
control so it's one has got lots of buttons could be yellow but we can play
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition was inverse be related to age
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
crap remote taking with their tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
button on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or focused
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of an lcd screen was brought
rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find specific target group were saying fifteen to thirty
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings adjust brightness
converts electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
economic we need to find out find a balance between features and price as you mentioned
work or infrared bulb which will then bring the data to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
coffee at the end you just only when really going on or even that those things can go out and you're happy
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
seventy five percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple
price limit of the twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
time you get specific in crap instructions from your personal coach emailed them to you and also putting
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
white or thereabouts draw
narrow down to maybe Teenagers and families
