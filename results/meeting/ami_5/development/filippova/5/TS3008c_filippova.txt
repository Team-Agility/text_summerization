functions maybe buttons like that and to control that's lcd
buttons on the in the remote control can lie on the table for a date and then you push a button
components of a remote control could just have a properties of material we have to choose
catch colours are you are many colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour
watching the tv gonna watch a remote control
telling me that when we build a remote control of of plastic or rubber the buttons the case itself and the rubber
talk about the materials it's a good idea to use the plastic in tears would softer rubber
resembles the design for a greater resemblance but with new with new colours
feel the whole idea really like it the lcd thing but it's not a good idea
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station at the bottom
possibility i i looked upon was the lcd display on that we do lots of information
spongy material and then you're gonna have like to material lines
thousand and four you can't put something on the market really likes really like set
banana is it's it's not easy for remote control
properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material like a hard plastic
faded the skip buttons and it should and the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
image which is it's symbolises the idea of fruit and vegetables i don't see the spongy
idea of maybe at that came kind type of body weight and then with plastic colouration rounded
part of the rc The up and the upper part or whatever it's it's not use wood buttons
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people dark colours simple recognisable shapes
sell will need to bring one line of tvs which we were planning
requirements i was thinking about just the basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
forgot the email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility to put a scroll button
colour lcd which is really pretty trendy but i don't think it will be too expensive
base station is also off the shelf also the speaker and wireless retriever are all available in our company
sell and then tie a title for programme or at least at a quite large part of it and then you get a very large lcd
transfer and plastic and a soft rubber of wood or titanium Would also be a bit weird
resemble what i already said a specific piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity
fruity thing is just the shape should be for today this is fruit just round curves
tv guide only for the channel with that we were for programs
time you would have teletext and the menu nowadays to access the screen settings
important because it has to be flash a bit and that is a an doesn't have to be in weighing day
easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple design which sturdy
design experts we will work that half
tv has to send information back began a resolution with it the goal is backs and colours
Drawl really nicely of the best we can put the logo and all that back
spongy thing already comes for in the in the cushions pets and things on this side
read the minutes are very hard to read because there are two documents that one layer
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
ia is still don't have any information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
base things we'll read discuss the know fees
reaches a different marked but it doesn't cost really much effort to bring a like a black
problem lights we have to incorporate slides
switch from softer works it's also too much to the lawn wanna spend
breaks it's not very solid it's first french
