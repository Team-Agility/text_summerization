important thing people like to last year was that the remote control should be look fancy
reacting projecting the buttons on the lcd screen i how much the actual remote
big difference between young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
entire thing in the corporate colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
button or if you have several options appearing on the screen would would not in the buttons
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
wood rubber the total piece of rubber is the best suits poll up material
options is the settings of the remote enough to tv and that a thing called cults settings
young people they liked fruity colours like reading brown light out dark red yellow
tie That what you'd like to do on the screen is want to go back
larger it's not really on scale then to work an option for mount station
change a scroll with the menu to look up some some channels on your television
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly people
volume we should also be enough for easy it's quite a simple lcd screen
shapes it is something between the square shape sit around got on the round corners what's square
colour titanium or you have to pay chip on print think cases are points
noticed that be in this file design or the user interface and the buttons
men about future of next to each other on a normal batteries not like to load
soft but if you should the feelings spongy use of sponge bob like face
point we already decided that on the previous meeting placed inside our project folder
lasting not not be anti it's a two minutes or thirty minutes of forty
sense that it you ask you give a question and three seconds later you say the answer
record into the device into the speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
agenda the base five presentation is once again or at least an agenda
