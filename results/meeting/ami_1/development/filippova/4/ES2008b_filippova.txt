stop i considering what remote control functions design for a remote their own remote controls
user interfaces controlling the chip through the use of the user interface is critical
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and the relevant the polls buttons
people are only using ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote
technical functions presentation working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
weapons you have like you have numbers but you before the next meeting in terms of users
designed to like this you have your energy source people don't wanna be changing
older people didn't really care for voice recognition was inverse be related to age
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv
people are so is that like change the volume changing the channel and changing
battery and that that the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy into data
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television and the power
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver
deadline the target group were saying fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
seventy five percent of that they would be willing to pay more for a fee and see you're looking remote
simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting
instruction manual it comes at the end that's and hot because of the combination
economic we need to find a balance between features and price as you mentioned
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest one and half people's
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
