tiny on the remote control when you're watching tv gonna watch a remote controls maybe can bring
catch colours are you are many colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour
materials and components of remote control the case the properties of material we have to choose
soft rubber double curved case you must use or rubber the buttons have to be rubber
feel the whole idea really like it the lcd thing but it's not a good idea
week with the lcd and the docking station is also off the shelf all the materials
faded the skip buttons and it should and the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
possibility i i looked upon was the lcd display on that we do lots of information
image which is it's symbolises the idea of fruit and vegetables i don't see the spongy
bring one line with the dark colour design and the them because i do that it dark
resembles the design already resemble some piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity
colour lcd which is really pretty trendy but i don't think it will be too expensive
requirements i was thinking about just the basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
start with the technical things we have to discuss
materials it's a good idea to use the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights
round it's always fun to have something take a plastic and a soft things and titanium
thousand and four you can't put something on the market really likes really like set
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv channel
forgot the email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility to put a scroll button
bring their logo and all that back began a resolution with it the goal is backs and colours
simple electronic all chip the chipset and the board it'll off the shelf also the speaker
read the minutes are very hard to read because there are two documents that one layer
combine it or with it yellow and black and white that's on the old grey
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease
ia is still don't have any information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
