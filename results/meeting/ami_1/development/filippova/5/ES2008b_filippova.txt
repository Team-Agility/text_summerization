stop i considering what remote control functions design for a remote their own remote controls all subjective
energy going to the user interfaces controlling the chip through the use of the user interface is critical
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design meeting
lots of buttons and the relevant the polls buttons could be yellow but we can play
people are only using ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote
technical functions presentation working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
weapons you have like you have numbers but you before the next meeting in terms of users
team make a schematic of the way that the energy source people don't wanna be changing
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition was inverse be related to age
crap remote taking with their tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume changing the channel settings
components that we find here are the energy or information to the chip takes the data
button on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or focused
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find specific target group were saying fifteen to thirty
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
seventy five percent of that they would be willing to pay more for a fee and see you're looking remote
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting
coffee at the end you just only when really going on or even that those things can go out and you're happy
economic we need to find a balance between features and price as you mentioned something called rsi
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest one and half people's
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
