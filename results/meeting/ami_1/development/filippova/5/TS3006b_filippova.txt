position of the screen is all the configuration options we want to put an lcd screen menu
research stated that users are not afraid of a lot of functions and these basic functions
power button and channel and volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons for a for all the channels
time this menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu button
prefer we use the basic function if you are going to use the advanced options and functions
people can say what's that one that's my remote control options so we need to menus
screen is here then the logo should be like on top which function is that we have left
channel five and phone account channel anything you want to move the only kind to channel program the channels
press said you the screen gets activated and then you can use this buttons to press the channel
User interface designer can design menu For all these functions or make the buttons as user-friendly
integrate the screen or speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
problem with the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen is below and the buttons are in the middle
channel and then it just say is which number in a remote and which want to save
functions and on the Seems was it the target that's a group so it's above forty
annoying most small phones and also have a screen like on a mobile phone also on top
plug in the power cable when you go back to it to upper level the finally
simple and all that advanced features are hidden in the screen with the clear which buttons
tv options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble i'm base
irrelevant the less use for audio settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour
signal of certain spatial frequencies it's a counters one it shows on your tv and so your remote
communication if the television it's difficult but that's not hard part you don't have to design
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
skip this price as because i read a ball forty is it from twenty to forty
news flash and teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information that i need so frustrating
