user interface i had it's more industrial think a point
financial part of this project implicates there's not going to be a high end product that cost price
annoying if you need to change the tvs state of the tv
bluetooth might be problem but bluetooth together in one remote
gentlemen just to remind we'd we have five minutes left for this meeting
device already using infra-red it's but old-fashioned if you would call that but all tvs
