Basic remote control from our plastic then the buttons
switch channel up button is like you switch channel
volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake
top buttons are wish there should be on top band
volume and top down is more with the channel it's on the bottom

original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod And and three players mobile phones
battery context like normal batteries just a rechargeable batteries expense
yellow on the side and black on the front
receive information about the cost but just a about the chip
usability is very important aspect is that you must make it fancy and it looks original
