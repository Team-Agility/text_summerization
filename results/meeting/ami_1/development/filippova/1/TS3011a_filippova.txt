television remote control should control one or more at ease of equipment
technical issues which i would like to present do you before we start discussion
technical function is what should the remote control
sense that remote it should work on different tvs
discussion maybe the time for sebastian to show his presentation
functional design stage is we will discuss are The for the ring
philips or whatever to buy our remote control we will work with some of the tools
account when developing this product we're going to develop
add idea about how the market will respond to that such product
role of the industrial designer is that correct
production cost should not be more than at twelve euro fifty
user interface i had it's more industrial think a point
financial part of this project implicates there's not going to be a high end product that cost price
annoying if you need to change the tvs state of the tv
bluetooth all the time twenty four hours a day
meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes
device already using infra-red it's but old-fashioned if you would call that but all tvs
remind people of some new texaco possibilities
point at the device and the range is very handy
decided to make a white board using this pen
red and the documents it should be in the project documents folder
feel the buttons that are applicable at that moment
choose not a colour a different line width
actions or your personal coach will probably email
