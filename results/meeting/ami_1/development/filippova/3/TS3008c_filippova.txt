displays remote control when you're watching tv gonna watch a remote controls
colours are you are many colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour
talk about the components of remote control could just have a properties
case you must use or rubber the buttons to that the rubber
idea is that a good idea we have already mentioned all arguments
design of the docking station is also off the shelf all the materials
buttons and it should and the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
possibility i i looked upon was the lcd display fits in that emission
pictures of fruit and vegetables And spongy material I found this image
bring one line with the dark colour design and the them because i do that it dark
design already resemble some piece of fruit but just like the round curves
colour lcd screen and it's very special a very trendy to have a remote control
decided to use only basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
start with the technical things we have to discuss
materials it's a good idea to use the plastic and the rubber
transfer and plastic is the best with rubber of wood or titanium
idea i've put some trends for the market likes really like set
tv guide only for the channel with that we were for programs
email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility to put a scroll button
weighing day began a resolution with it the goal is backs and colours
simple electronic all chip the chipset and the board it'll off the shelf also the speaker
easy for you to read the minutes left my know how many colours
combine it or with it yellow and black and white that's on the old grey
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease
ia is still don't have any information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
