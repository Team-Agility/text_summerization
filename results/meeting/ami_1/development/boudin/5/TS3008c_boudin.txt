lawn wanna spend more money on the remote control when you're watching tv or your hands a little bit sweaty
colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour look like it the plastic mold is in one colour and thus those cushion pets around it are in another colour set
materials and components of remote control the case the properties of material we have to choose
telling me that when we build a remote control of of plastic or rubber the buttons to that the rubber double curved case is is it a three dimensional curve in the design
control if that's a good idea of maybe at that came kind type of body weight and then with plastic colouration rounded
week with the lcd and the docking station is also off the shelf all the materials
number so we have the power button skip the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
mode after the trailers of lcd display i don't want to in a three the house
year are surprisingly fruits and vegetables And spongy material I found this image which is it's symbolises the idea of fruit is a yellow green red whatever sell
reaches a different marked but it doesn't cost really much effort to bring one line with the dark colour
resembles the design already resemble some piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity thing is just the shape should be for today this is fruit just round curves
sell and then tie a title for programme or at least at a quite large part of it and then you get a very large lcd screen and it's very special a very trendy to have a remote control
puts an extra x and on the simplicity of our remotes to make these two most basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
start with the technical things we have to discuss
properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material like a hard plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights we have to incorporate slides
round it's always fun to have something take a plastic is the best with rubber of wood or titanium
thousand and four you can't put something on the market which is on the ground
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
forgot the email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility to put a scroll button
tv has to send information back began a resolution with it the goal is backs and colours is very important because it has to be flash a bit and that is a an doesn't have to be in weighing day when you're gonna something's
skip the house as easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple electronic all chip the chipset and the board it'll off the shelf also the speaker and wireless retriever are all available in our company
part of the minutes are very hard to read because there are two documents that one layer
combine it or with it yellow and black and white that's on the old grey
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease
ia is still don't have any information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
