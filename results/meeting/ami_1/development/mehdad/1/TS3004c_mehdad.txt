remote controls the buttons are part of the just it's part of the remote control
hold it you can't all the control and push the buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons like text easy to put that on the button you knew a lot more like the that meant that and they three player
current control are all black and plastic it's that our problem
Light switches on if you use a button and that takes a few buttons more often than the normal channel of the time
putting the volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake
top and buttons are wish there should be on top band that if we gonna put in more technology eugene need to be able to switch to open
numbers should be in the bottom and the switch channel in the middle
aspect and we must use some of the new technology to be innovative big door
sense if you put it somewhere in the chances the beautiful scroll wheel
spec to the remote control should be easy to know me for a push to the yup
show you the And i the the menu to that what's it called scroll-wheel make it in yellow just like the colours blue red and green colour the backlight
decided that we don't to make use of a lcd or speech recognition
display requires an advanced chip can be a simple a regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced
date display in the ipod a compared to the basic or you can choose one if you buy the project
divide you have to round it on the button and of skip
original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod And and three players mobile phones
energy source we can use batteries just a rechargeable battery that's cheaper
yellow on the side and black on the front so we put on the market
strange that i receive any information about the cost but just a about the chip boards
usability is very important people that want to spend money on something that's similar to a cheaper
drop it you wanna change the volume only if you use your finger
sense for an original look and feel of the case transparent on the wise the backlight one work together on a prototype drawing a smartboard
tad next aspect also in contrast to last year the feel of material suspect it is expected to the role on this one at this moment
target group we talk about was young public you should use materials or soft with primary colours like green blue red so Flashy kinda colours the shape
stands for a new technical features and then that this is a point else or a sample speaker unit will give a standard answer of should recognise the question
