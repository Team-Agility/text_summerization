talk about the technical functions design of the remote their own remote control what we want to do it sends a message
suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different at the types of user who's controlling the chip through the use of the user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
sense we're gonna have to aim for a design which is fairly conventional in design it's gonna be crucial
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and that might be older people
time of tape ten percent of the people maybe people who have problem with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons that they have offered to them on the remote and that ties
includes an emphasis on making the infrared very functional requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled That extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design they need to be figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
Space is similar to a very basic weapons you have like you have number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
age so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus in and those volume and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel settings
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy into data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move data to the receiver
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or adjust
talk about a general findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d data is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
talk about our functions and our target group that means that is very few we need to each group
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicate like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen was brought
seventy five percent of that they would be willing to pay more for a fee and see you're looking remote
aiming for a technological advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
easiest thing to do is to break down all the end of the spectrum
mentioned something called rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel between features and price limit of the twelve and a half euro
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest one and half people's problems
Switch the quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
