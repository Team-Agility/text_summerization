research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition technology
requirements i'd give it a marketing report is to tv remote court
pretty wide range of remote control shouldn't be very they have looked pretty
produce the tv you can have a lot of these background noise from a tv
cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important
buttons it increases the difficulty of find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
restrict the remote control to tv only because of time but on the On the chip
industrial designer should work was supposed to work on the components concepts
program name instead of the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad
channels that you two digit numbers and you have to press a button
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
user interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
focus more on the internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
seoul extend past the hand shape and it should not be really small
master a very easy to handle to scroll not too big difference
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting there on the remote control
electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
eds they're more like and they good idea is to it looks like a year
