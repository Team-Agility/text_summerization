screen it's more about the functions are are going to to be on the screen
research stated that users are not afraid of a lot of function and they speak
easy so for just a zapping around channel and left or right for the volume
menu and then you have to decide it in a way that is user friendly
basic function if you are going to use the advanced one but a lot of options
layout of the remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
wary of space left and then put a logo should be like on top of sweet
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program the channels
press a button and the teacher a goes It it sends a signal to a chip which are translates
design of the bus buttons but look how you can push them and like that so the physical aspect
incorporated in the screen and the speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
concentrate more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen
channel and then it just say is which number do you want to save
functions and on the Seems was it the target that's a group of forty
microphone it can be very small phones and also have a screen like on a mobile phone
plug in the power cable when you go back to it to upper level which twos and focus
features are hidden in the screen with the clear in the design of the remote
sound settings if you do is like a very and now base you need to change
problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway and lots of the times there is a brand present
threw it at transformer it's the signal gets a boost that and then sent to the tv and that if you will Translated into a function
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television it's difficult
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
people of sixteen to twenty five to thirty five to forty years of thirty
news flash and teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
spend a lot of time to integrate that information that i need so frustrating
