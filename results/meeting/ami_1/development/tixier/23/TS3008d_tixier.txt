mb and a lot of remote control where it was useful to have a kind a like power source
signal which it would also sent we put a separate button when you're talking about at this just a signal
matching the two buttons we place them in the middle the menu and for the teletext
problem now is that the There's no such thing as a docking station and cost of the remote control
concept there's something special we looked at the form colours and colour or give them a special
deem them must be innovative technology for remote controls one more in our you controls not in how you finder
push a button it sends it immediately to the television there will be one and align it which is it and displaced
docking station for two euros if you don't put the recharge function and that's in the one button when you wanna find
chip and with the retriever a device it will costa a bit more like a high in the advanced chip
Schematic few of the remote control what nothing about the advanced chip but the scroll wheel in it requires you if you vision
imagine that would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents for upper bound
watch it's a kinetic thing we could do to do a compromise in which you can kinetic
colour as the rubber on the side
remote controls that down at these buttons but you still can know you can still select the twenty a number in the twenty times an hour
rubber parts and it's the readiness of thing and then when you move the round of my notes
calculator also works on our own solar cells more projects than only remote controls
excel in on the in the range in the field of design and the looks and feel
cheap that's just a regular power cable with a buttons on it We do retrieval a device
call a lot of problems The sample sensor slash sample speaker unit
eighty percent of the price of of the amount of button you have to put it in a carton board
leave the retrieve in such a side that will be a strip of rubber and in the middle
question is usable it will be bought by people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries
lowest part of it so when it's the same as the other products go deeper
gotta fill out a questionnaire to be honest
important part of these meeting
