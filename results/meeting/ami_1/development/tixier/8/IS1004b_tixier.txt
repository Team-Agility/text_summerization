research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
people want to be l to find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition
red so if you go to the market or what so the remote
scroll was actually pretty a pretty wide range of remote controls
produce the tv you can have a lot of these background noise from a tv
relation to know you would be cheaper than the lcd
buttons it increases the difficulty of find out a solution
control to tv only because of time but on the On the chip
industrial designer should work was supposed to work on the components concepts
channel already what's on If you have a list of programmed an lcd screen just for change the channel
press a button to enter to do and then the summer
move to another does it because i twenty five dollars
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
user interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
focus more on the internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
master a very easy to handle to scroll not too big
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting there on the remote control
electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
scd e still on this get used to open to discussion
