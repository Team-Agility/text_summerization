hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons would recharge the battery
lots of buttons for the features of the ipod the things you would use all the case out of plastic them the main
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
people to be able to use it as a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
simply it's cheaper to make pushbuttons and it is a scroll thing would be too fast
scroll through the channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
find a way to protect like the chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip
tend to watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv and the button to changing
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery is worse things get most exciting
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
determine what the essential functions of the device that is going to be useful to people
buttons could be shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours maybe free vegetable colours
fashion in our case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
properties of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface and we'll come back to the chip
intrigued by the idea that these are the options of using the kinetic that you don't have to replace
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
information back to the remote control list a topic of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
sending it out's only fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
plastic but we have all these fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
