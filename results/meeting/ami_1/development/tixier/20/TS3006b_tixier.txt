list of what functions are are going to to be on the screen
research stated that users are not afraid of a lot of function
button and channel and left or right for the volume
menu and then you have to decide it in a way that is user friendly
advanced one but a lot of options and functions and buttons is easy
layout of the remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
wary of space left and then put a logo should be like on top of sweet
harder to if you have already program it to swap
figure or figure out a way to do that easily
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
concentrate more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen
week or on the channel number do you want to save
update for the audience or the target that's a group of forty
microphone it can be very small if you look at your mobile
reach a little bit for the power cable when you go back to it to upper level which twos and focus
features are hidden in the screen with the clear in the design of the remote
sound and then within sounds i trouble i'm base you need to change
problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway and lots of the times there is a brand present
threw it at transformer it's the signal gets a boost that and then sent to the tv and that if you will Translated into a function
consequences on the marketing a part you don't have to design
working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
people of sixteen to twenty five to thirty five to forty
news flash and teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
spend a lot of time to integrate that information that i need so frustrating
