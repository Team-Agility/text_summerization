process i'm thinking about that either part you could argue that the remote control
simple button and speech recognition and it's cheap or a remote control we want to reduce
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a i'll put that says creaky what they are actions
integrate some into our remote control something like a light kills a lcd screen was different colours
advanced chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive compared to lcd
remote control we should be easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology
flat different colours Depending on what is around like what colours around and depending on the temperature
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and battery
ready in the post and down to locate then we have to go for some speaker
plastic we stick with two batteries solar smart
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
story that for the point before why not the rubber aspect might be important
record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
propose but the use of solar cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy would solar cells hand
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week about the last year now it has to be spongy
interestingly this is the very most important one is that it has to be fancy
concept of the interface concept what interface we used and if there is some supplements
sixty then you make a lot of money are you don't and you're out of business
friends you can travel from golf to furniture so it might be fruit and vegetable
reduce the cost on the display would only be displayed and not a touch sensitive
trend i hope i'm going to try to help you want that this is more risky
meeting are on the them first and component concept so what energy and the media and the interface for energy
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning
puts lots of concentrate
