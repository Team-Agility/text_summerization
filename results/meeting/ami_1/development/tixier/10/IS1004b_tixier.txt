research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
increasing the unit price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
top of the could be a speech recognition technology does mean sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find
red so if you go to the market and you say that buttons that they're the people it is and on top
pretty wide range of remote control shouldn't be very they have looked pretty hard
produce the tv you can have a lot of these background noise from a tv
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared to also use going to implement
buttons it increases the difficulty of find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
restrict the remote control to tv only because of time but on the On the chip
industrial designer should work was supposed to work on and so on the working
channel already what's on If you have a list of programmed an lcd screen you just scroll for that program name instead of the channel
channels that you two digit numbers and you have to press a button to speak and the tvt v set
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
work and user interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
focus more on the internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
teletext but we want to get read one of four requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
master a very easy to handle to scroll not too big courts and that cords out of stand-by then for a device to the receiver
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting there on the remote control
electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
eds they're more like and they good idea is to it looks like a year
