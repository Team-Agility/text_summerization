research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
people want to be l to find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
top of the could be a speech recognition
requirements i'd give it a marketing report
scroll was actually pretty a pretty wide range of remote controls
produce the tv you can have a lot of these background noise from a tv
relation to know you would be cheaper than the lcd
buttons it increases the difficulty of find
time to start time all the programs
work it does work was supposed to work on the components concepts
channel already what's on If you have a list of programmed an lcd screen just for change the channel
press a button to enter to do and then the summer
move to another does it because i twenty five dollars
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
user interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
focus more on the internet capability
requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
design should be similar to the traditional
easy to handle to scroll not too big
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
la is that the court is sitting there on the remote control
electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
scd e still on this get used to open to discussion
