press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
economics it's probably better to push buttons would recharge the battery
lots of buttons for the features of the ipod the things you would use all the case
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu on the lcd screen
people to be able to use it as a remote control
intrigued by the idea of the scroll buttons to scroll
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel flipping and then the other white
find a way to protect like the chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip
tend to watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery

member of that this is the device that is going to be useful to people
shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours we could colour
hurt you say have one case probably with a variety of design elements
properties of the user interface and we'll come back to the chip
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
list a topic of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
minute or if you the minutes left of the meeting
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
fashion and simplicity and easy to use is necessarily the right drinking personally
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
