suspect a remote their own remote controls all subjective
industrial design if you're components concept user interface the user interfaces controlling the chip
users using a remote control so it's one has got lots of buttons with essentials
mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled That extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design presentation and the functional requirements that people satisfied
parts of the working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
time of tape ten people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people who have problems with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
Space is similar to a very basic weapons you have like you have numbers and sports colours
combination of electrical energy source people don't wanna be changing
people are only using ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote and that ties
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
people are so is that like change channel changing the volume
older people didn't really care for voice recognition
control in this index opinions on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or focused
investment should use novel idea of an lcd screen was brought
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls in the analysing
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find specific target group
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
components that we find here are the energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip transmitting information to the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying
features and price as you mentioned something called rsi
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion in electronics
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest one and half people's problems
number to make it technologically the end of select
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range of ages
narrow down to maybe Teenagers and families
