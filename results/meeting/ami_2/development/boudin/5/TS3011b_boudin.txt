round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
important thing what a remote control is just a function of remote controls and let them buttons
video sets and and there's a special button that find the remote control button remote control function
functions and the money that we can say from that we should use for having a design and thinking about the user interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
function and the problem to programme button or change the channel or to not the volume
top goal of this meeting is to reach decision on the product on the target group and the functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all functions available device
relevance scale the channel selection you have them to most important or volume selection and the teletext
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet is replacing teletext
home station for base station next a tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
numbers about the speech recognition here that's younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people like new features
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons you have that's the cheaper that the chip which just a voice recognition our circuit boards
implementing this a function the technical design or energy save design we should really implement fancy techniques
problem is it but it depends on the decisions disease up in this since it's the best and makes about the voice recognition the data
user interface connect to chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
hope personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment but it's quite elaborate
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound from other sounds
find a balance between the advanced new techniques and the user friendliness
hebrew i bet devices which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume and the programme one and some fancy lights
user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger parts off the market isn't the forty percent the buttons
work i have no time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
dark concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion and ease of use remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling in touching the buttons
disadvantages that there are so concerns about the costs and things like that battery lifetime energy saving another advantage
fully concentrate on developing a product that is really what the market will Examples will change adapt
draw the ten minutes i make into the shared folder
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
