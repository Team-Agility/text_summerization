user remotes you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons which is what real reaction
lots of buttons for the features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
high-tech in have an llc d screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control get a certain amount of a light
buttons for your favourite channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast
bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as or the case you get bored
pushbuttons the require a simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip in an lc
features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv and people when i watch tv in the dark
idea of the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
type of battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
ri uses for buttons to me to move around so range of settings so on a small lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
round remote instead of like a rubber button down one like in terms of holding it like that so if she to a fruit and vegetable colours we could colour
model is a going to be for user interaction with this device going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay
essential properties of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface list of device
international be on we said but for all age groups different functions to keep the remote from getting lost a large buttons for the essential functions a possibility for extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on cost other than it's more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
minutes a new type things you look and feel design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
kinda like in the idea of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard plastic inside it just cover with the latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
hit my understanding of old latex cases that it's hard to protect inside but it's covered
list a matter how many buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
designer of our real reaction company wind focus on fashion in technological elements we can add in the word latex titanium or rubber or other coloured types of plastic
sending it out's only fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
simple regular advanced chip-on-print as that machine prince on the wires and source
fickle a or latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
