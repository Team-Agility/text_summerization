remote doubled curved case you must use or rubber the buttons to that the rubber
control if that's a good idea of maybe at that came kind type of body weight and then with plastic colouration rounded
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station at the bottom
price also for monochrome lcd display i don't want to in a three the house
