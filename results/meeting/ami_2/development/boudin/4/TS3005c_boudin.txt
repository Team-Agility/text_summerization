big so it's it's really an important thing people like to last year was that the remote controls
work with the lcd screen i how much the actual remote control itself yelling
pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
chip on print what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button when you get a lcd screen
big difference between young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly people
spots but also possible to create fancy colours wood rubber is the best suits poll up material
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
large a button or if you have several options appearing on the screen the colour nations
hand there and then you want touch the screen is want to go back it's a big button go back
options is the settings of the remote enough to tv and that a thing called cults settings
personal preferences for the young peoples like a fruity colours Innovative all the colleges you blue red white yellow
chip on print think cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
settings menu to look up some some channels on your television use is called a scroll up next to the remote isn't that handy
printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
option to use as a in a rather simple rechargeable batteries
shapes like a week you said is that's easy better or for the elderly people something like that Like the ipod do something with the round shapes
schools it is in the actual design and user interface are also some questions about the concepts you have some ideas
easy way to a program that you say record into the device into the speaker
hard materials like wood the titanium or you have to pay chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip
soft but if you should the feelings spongy use of sponge bob like face
Channel selection for our one of the sixty eight volume we should also be enough for easy
point we already decided that on the previous meeting placed inside our project folder
sense that it you ask you give a question and three seconds later you say the answer
show some points on which we it should take a decision
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone for the speech recognition
meeting is once again in thirty minutes or thirty minutes of forty minutes of use Nx
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
recharge through docking station
agenda the base five presentation is once again or at least an agenda
