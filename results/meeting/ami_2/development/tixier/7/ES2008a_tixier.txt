assume that it's just a television that we want to control
complex over Did combining all the remotes around my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes
individual work and a meeting
industrial design only now we doing on the working design
generate a little bit of discussion about the project it could have like to you by your experiences using rubber remote controls
buttons and you have to pass on the tv
tv that you have to do one for the power of in front of me and one for the tv
define what or aiming for if it's just a television
hoping that we can all work together to achieve
programmed into it's all just in a separate place and not like all the on button see a doctor
buttons that you need to programme the video recorder
supply and i really wanna do is change the channel
user interface designer that's real that's Technical functions i like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons on the user requirements
save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would need to use every day
working on this one for about twenty so we continue
end up to multimedia overload it just wanna watch
rose and then i'll be the project manager
sounds like we've had a good little session for our first ideas mind
breakdown of what will be doing individually the industrial
necessarily it's i have a solution favourite animal
discussion that we've been having we'll get from the actual concern is consumers
meeting starts in thirty minutes and probably numbers
user requirements so do we hearing about different runs how about different things that people
specific instructions sent by your personal coach i realised
bob of into a quaint and so just going to know each other little bit including a tool
opening and then i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project bob of into a quaint
range we do have to worry about specifics
order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro So we're sell
