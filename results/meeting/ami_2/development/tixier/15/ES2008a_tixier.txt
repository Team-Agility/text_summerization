creating a new remote control for television that we want to control
remotes around my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes
individual work and a meeting
industrial design only now we doing on the working design
generate a little bit of discussion about the project it could have like to you by your experiences using rubber remote controls
buttons and you have to pass to actually turn on the tv
tv that you have to do one for the power of in front of me and one for the tv
stick to having television on the top it simpler to show us buttons
street moving it around to get it to work together to achieve
programmed into it's all just in a separate place and not like all the on button see a doctor
play in the court and stop buttons that you need to programme the video recorder
supply and i really wanna do is change the channel change the volume and at the right remote with all the special
user interface designer that's real that's Technical functions i like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons on the user requirements
save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would need to use every day
working on this one for about twenty so we continue next time
draw a little Turtle for you all Not necessarily like that if like to end up to multimedia overload it just wanna watch
rose and then i'll be the project manager From california
sounds like we've had a good little session for our first ideas mind
breakdown of what will be doing individually the industrial
necessarily it's i have a solution favourite animal i have no draw skills whatsoever
discussion that we've been having we'll get from the actual concern is consumers
meeting starts in thirty minutes and probably numbers
user requirements so do we hearing about different runs how about different things that people
specific instructions sent by your personal coach i realised in this past
bob of into a quaint and so just going to know each other little bit including a tool
opening and then i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project bob of into a quaint
television at the with the market range of the internet like it's in international market range we do have to worry about specifics
order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro So we're sell
