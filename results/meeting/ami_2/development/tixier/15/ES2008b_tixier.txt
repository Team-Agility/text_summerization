critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control
suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different at the types of user interface
users using a remote control so it's one has got lots of buttons
source and talk a little bit about functional design of the remote control
easiest thing to do is gonna be work design they need to be figure
appeals to younger people who have problem with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
people are so is that like change the channel and changing the volume
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition but at the price
button that allows us to do certain effects on the television and the power
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
web to to see if i could find a way of striking a balance
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
target group that means that is very few we need to each group
bring the data is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip takes the data to the receiver
simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
finally it is more marketing our corporate image has to be recognisable
economic we need to find a wheel and for me as to what rsi
uh_huh fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
worry about four minutes i emailed them to you and also putting
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
easiest thing to do is to break down all the end of the spectrum
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
