concentrate more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen
confirm a want to go one step back it's only two extra buttons
button in the middle of it says menu for all the functions you don't use regular
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable fashion
basic function if you are going to use the advanced one but a lot of options
easy so for just a zapping around channels and left or right for the volume
wary of space left and then put a logo should be like on top of sweet
indy it's the remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program the channels
press a button and the teacher a goes It it sends a signal to a chip which are translates
options and lcd option to go back to it to upper level the finally
speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
menu and then you have to decide it in a way that is user friendly
reach a little bit for the power button and channel volume selection are teletext
channel and then it just say is which number do you want to save
hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle
update for the audience or the target that's a group of forty
features are hidden in the screen with the clear in the design of the remote
microphone it can be very small if you look at your mobile
visuals of the bride this with that sliding bar and the boss and the like that for sound settings if you do is like a very and now base you need to change
television itself is also the options that brightness and screen colour etcetera
working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
threw it at transformer it's the signal gets a boost that and then sent to the tvs on the tv
research stated that users are not afraid of a lot of functions
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television
spend a lot of time to integrate that information that i need so frustrating
people of sixteen to twenty five to thirty five to forty years of thirty
received an email so i'd like we'll use so i'd just drop it in the folder
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
