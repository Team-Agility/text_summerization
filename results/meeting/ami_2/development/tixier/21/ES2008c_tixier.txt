press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons
lots of buttons for the features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu
people to be able to use it as a remote control concepts

button to switch off in case out of plastic them the main
chip we can have a simple to shaking around will make it work
tend to watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace

order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the real materials
fashion and simplicity and easy to use is necessarily the right drinking personally
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
fickle a or latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
