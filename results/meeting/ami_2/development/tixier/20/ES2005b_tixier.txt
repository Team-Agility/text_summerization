remote control it applies to something and it glows in the dark about this sectors
consumers they're willing to have pay more for speech recognition and whistling
Seventy five percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons
eyes was that the This is for a specific television
functions for tv but as you pointed out people would require
sorta speech interface to it you only need to find
users of data more a tv and then also made it pick up the noise and turn
miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and how it fixed
kinda feels a bit different from a lot of remote controls the rubber
interface design a user interface for this to be just a bunch of buttons
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television
subtract a cancellation of the noise reference problem they mentioned
speak recognition limit the number of button and if you hit
user can put in their favourite channels and maybe they prefer to find settings that wanna turn on and start blasting
bells and whistle we gotta come up with a gimmick but not too complicated
told us that Consumers are willing to spend more for fancy product
in-house so much more market ancient art of how we should design can do other remote controls forty should be there so as to in a house or a sales
mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick essentially
major factor to load take into consideration when i was a profit
noise over certain threshold on a topic up as a distress signal on from you and i'll be back
cheaper than tft it's just a microphone and some integrated circuits
definite requirements that they will that we need to scroll
electronics so we as the company we want to make a product trendy in fashion a big concern
encoding i'm getting from little bits of what channel and being sent is that they're quite interested in tft display interactive display
integrating the rabbit integrate the logo on as bright yellow
update but it anyway so your hand that they require of that it's very hard
decided in the last meeting that i have to find
organic shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corner don't feel just as gimmicky
paris only i prefer this one just because it's and it's easy
opposed to with batteries we don't need to provide all we pride fast batteries but it's more it's that's cheaper to justify battery
