hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons would recharge the battery
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
people to be able to use it as a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
buttons to select your favourite channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
intrigued by the idea of the scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast
button to switch off in case out of plastic them the main ones being like and lemons or stripe
regular or advanced chip we can have a simple to shaking around will make it work
tend to watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv and the button to changing
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery is worse things get most exciting
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
buttons could be shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours maybe free vegetable colours
member of that this is the device going to work together on a model using modelling clay
concept of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface and we'll come back to the chip
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information back to the remote control list
fashion in our case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
kinda like in the idea of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard plastic inside it just cover with the latex
hit my understanding of old latex cases that it's hard to protect inside but it's covered
point having a television and it's sit on the other side we thought of it a little text
research has been carried out by real materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
plastic but we have all these fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
sending it out's only fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
fickle a or latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options that we have for manufacturing
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
