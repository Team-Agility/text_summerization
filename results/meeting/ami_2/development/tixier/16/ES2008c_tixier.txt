hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons would recharge the battery
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu on the lcd screen
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel flipping and then the other white
intrigued by the idea of the scroll an actual i got ipods scroll button
button to switch off in case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
circuit board and chip we can have a simple to shaking around will make it work
tend to watch tv in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
buttons could be shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours we could colour
member of that this is the device that is going to be useful to people
properties of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface and we'll come back to the chip
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information back to the remote control list
fashion in our case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
kinda like in the idea of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard plastic inside it just cover with the latex
hit my understanding of old latex cases that it's hard to protect the circuit board
list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the real materials
plastic but we have all these fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
sending it out's only fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
fickle a or latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options that we have for manufacturing
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
