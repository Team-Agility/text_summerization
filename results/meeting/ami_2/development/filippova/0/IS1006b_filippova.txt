people are very frustrated with their remote controls
Current remote controls are not so easy
target a user personalised a remote control he for targeting
controls or we can have more functions for tv remote control
show you some of the results we found one be survey
buttons should be easy to find a good button
phones some of the phones have some of these so functionality phone that you can phone your phone
aim at a young people use these big
control we would have each one and that was our own personal settings
main head and device to do the particular action
market expert some again show up on that trend watching
focusing on all work and a place to waste actual remote control
inset some chip in the device
volume or a tree be something like volume
user interface and kinda intentions and I was an adjustment
relevant it seems that people find teletext they're relevant
Simple actions but to be universal
People really need to go to channel number
hope you're ready for use a functional design
volume is not really speech recognition
screen was the backlight which can change colours
generate some information to the main device
hundreds of channels that's not so easy
wheels focus on the components concept
simple speech recogniser on or ds be cheap
time you need to switch on or switch
automatic on off is also a big problem idea
control so we should pretty spend lots of time doing this presentation
rsi but i don't remember what you sarah
target is only like four point five euros
