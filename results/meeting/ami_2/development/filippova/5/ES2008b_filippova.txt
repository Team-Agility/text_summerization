personally what i want from a remote their own remote control is a device that simple
energy going to the user interfaces controlling the chip through the use of the user interface is critical
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and the relevant the polls buttons hired
talk about the technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements that people satisfied
parts of the working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people
weapons you have like you have numbers but you before the next meeting in terms of users
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people
people are only using ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume changing the channel settings
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition was inverse be related to age
button on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or focused
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of an lcd screen was brought
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls in the analysing
crap remote taking with their tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen

work or infrared bulb which will then bring the data to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip transmitting information to the chip and convert that much data
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
finally it is more marketing our corporate image has to be recognisable
economic we need to find a balance between features and price as you mentioned something called rsi
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest one and half people's
coffee at the end you just only when really going on or even that those things can go out and you're happy
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
