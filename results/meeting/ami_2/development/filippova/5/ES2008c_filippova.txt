press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons but i'm it intrigued
lots of buttons for the features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu on the lcd screen
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control get a certain amount of a light
buttons for your favourite channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast
case out of plastic them the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons
decided on like a simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip depending
features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv and people when i watch tv in the dark
idea of the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
lcd display would have to be quite small lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
ideas had it possibly use these and how to use a fruit and vegetable or or the spongy material
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end up with the device going to work
essential properties of the user interface we have to decide on whether i have a scroll
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
television send information on cost other than it's more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
feel and as these are range the top one is double curved case it can have any titanium
minimalist taken this design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard plastic inside it just cover with the latex it's a spongy
hit my understanding of old latex cases that it's hard to protect inside but it's covered
matter how many buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting on the other side
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
sending it out's only fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
fickle a or latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options that we have for manufacturing
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
