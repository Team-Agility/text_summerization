personally what i want from a remote their own remote control is a device that simple
user interfaces controlling the chip through the use of the user interface is critical
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and that might be older people
talk about the technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements that people satisfied
parts of the working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
appeal to people maybe people losing it too if it's the it's a fun
weapons you have like you have numbers but you before the next meeting in terms of users
designed to like this you have your energy source people don't wanna be changing
people are only using ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
people are so is that like change the volume changing the channel and changing
older people didn't really care for voice recognition was inverse be related to age
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television and the power
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
web to to see if i could find a way of striking a balance
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
deadline the target group that means that is very few we need to each group
work or infrared bulb which will then bring the data to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
brings energy source the battery and that that the chip and convert that much data
simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
finally it is more marketing our corporate image has to be recognisable
economic we need to find a balance between features and price as you mentioned
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest one and half people's
instruction manual it comes at the end of select other than just media but code
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
