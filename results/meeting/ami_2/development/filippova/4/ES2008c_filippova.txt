press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons but i'm it intrigued
lots of buttons for the features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
high-tech in have an llc d screen menu button so that we can access
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control
buttons to select your favourite channels and the channel flipping and then the other white
thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll an actual i got ipods scroll button
case the buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main
simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip in an lc
features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv and people when i watch tv in the dark
intrigued by the idea of the kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches
solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
small lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
ideas had it possibly use these and how to use a fruit and vegetable colours
end up with the device going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay
concept of the user interface we have to decide on whether i have a scroll
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
information on cost other than it's more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
feel and as these are range the top one is double curved case it can have any titanium
conceptual design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
hit my understanding of old latex cases that it's hard to protect like the chip
matter how many buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting on the other side
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
sending it out's only fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
fickle a or latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
