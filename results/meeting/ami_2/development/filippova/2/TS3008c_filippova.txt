components of a remote control could just have a properties
colours are you are many colours are we gonna wear
case you must use or rubber the buttons to that the rubber
idea is that a good idea we have already mentioned all arguments
design of the docking station is something for the bus
possibility i i looked upon was the lcd display level
image which is it's symbolises the idea of fruit and vegetables
buttons and it should and the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
match with that or old basic functions maybe buttons larger
open the conceptual design already resemble some piece of fruit
base station is also off the shelf also the speaker
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people dark

material it was a good idea to use the plastic
thousand and four you can't put something on the market likes
email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility to put a scroll button
tv guide only for the channel with that we were for programs
warm use my pen anymore so be it just ordinary keyboard
top marks by having an lcd screen on top of it isn't for mobile
resemble what i already said a specific piece of fruit but just like the round curves
sell will need to bring their logo and all that back
colour lcd which is really pretty trendy but i don't think it will be too expensive
mute and the teletext and the menu nowadays to access the screen settings
back began a resolution with it the goal is backs and colours
ia is still don't have any information about the program
easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple
part of the minutes are very hard to read text
fruit is a yellow real young men and then make styles
war after to give it to do the soft touch in your hands
