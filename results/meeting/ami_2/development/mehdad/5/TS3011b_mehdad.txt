easier way of a round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
important thing for people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control is just a function of remote control
device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find first before you can find your remote control button remote control function
dec design we can make a design and thinking about the user interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to switch to to channels when you have something and channel four n something on channel switching
top goal of this meeting is to reach decision on the product on the target group and the functions do you want an explicit list which include all function if it's possible within the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
stick for volume control and channel selection you have them to most important function In one button
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten device you would have to walk you tv
important button And there are lots of people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons you have that's the cheaper that the chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
expensive and they're hard to implement this a function and can be implemented in in our design will become more complicated
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition the data
user interface connect to chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
hope personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the cost rr in just a part of the equipment that's not a moderate
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound from other sounds
market is interested in some advanced new techniques and the user friendliness
cell phone just one like in the device which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume and the programme one and some fancy light and techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
user friendliness and it can be more trendy in and use design and energy sparse friendly components
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger part is forty percent of the market
generates a few times within that a certain period of time to perform are individual work i have no time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
summary of all things are spoken and the different possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
components which can zoom far less power saving will be a bit more difficult so we can expect that there will be unless longer life energy save costs by not implementing a lot of functions
fully concentrate on developing a product that is really what the market would respond to a simple
draw the ten minutes i make into the shared folder
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
