assume that it's just a television mean if it for taking it does right that's a New product a new television remote control which we have three goals about it needs to be original
complex over Did combining all the remotes around my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes
conceptual design individual work and a meeting
define this up in the three compact three parts first the functional design only now we doing on the working design
generate a little bit of discussion about the project it could have like to you by your experiences using rubber remote controls
remotes ten to have buttons that the tvs you should have to walk all around the room together to turn on so it's just simple are just to just pass on the tv
tv on that note that happen on the remote a number of a beep or a corporate so now in terms of how we're gonna make it but if it's like all the tv one for the digital box one for the video recorder
define what or aiming for if it's just a television on the top it simpler to show us buttons
street moving it around to get it to work with the infrared
programmed into it's all just in a separate place and not like all the on button see a doctor know like minimum trained
play in the court and stop buttons that you need to programme the video recorder or programme it's other things that i'm not a coherent
supply and i really wanna do is change on and off change the channel change the volume and at the right remote with all the special
user interface designer that's real that's Technical functions i like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons on the user requirements
save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would need to use every day
working on this one for about twenty so we continue discussing more new ideas
draw a little Turtle for you all Not necessarily like that if like to end up to multimedia overload it just wanna watch
rose and then i'll be the project manager From california
sounds like we've had a good little session for our first ideas mind if we move
breakdown of what will be doing individually the industrial
necessarily it's i have a solution favourite animal i have no draw skills whatsoever
discussion that we've been having we'll get from the actual concern is consumers
meeting starts in thirty minutes and probably numbers
user requirements so do we hearing about different runs how about different things that people or people like me that are fake court needed hand i it's really quite important that you're not pressing a small teeny mobile phones size buttons
specific instructions sent by your personal coach i realised in this past
bob of into a quaint and so just going to know each other little bit including a tool training exercise a normal
opening and then i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project bob of into a quaint
television at the with the market range of the internet like it's in international market range we do have to worry about specifics
order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro So we're sell
glad you get a common really set
