tiny on the remote control when you're watching the tv gonna watch a remote controls in a look at two colours
talk about the components of a remote control the case the properties of material we have to choose
harder but also on the colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour look like it the plastic mold is in one colour and thus those cushion pets around it are in another colour set
telling me that when we build a remote control of of plastic or rubber the buttons has to be solid two and the material and then the rubber double curved case is is it a three dimensional curve in the design
fire i was thinking about the of the we still want the joystick if that's a good idea of maybe is a little bit Too much for twelve and a half Abduction
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station at the bottom
possibility i i looked upon was the lcd display on that we do lots of information
symbols of fruits and vegetables And spongy colours I found this image which is it's symbolises the idea of fruit
part of the rc The up and the upper part or whatever it's it's not use wood buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons but that goes to that they have to be large
puts an extra x and on the simplicity of our remotes to make these two most basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons like that and to control test
open the conceptual design already resemble some piece of fruit
email with a with an remote control and you want to retrieve it and the base station is also off the shelf and even the speaker and wireless retriever are all available in our company
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people were a little bit crazy in one maybe want a little younger design and the them because i do that it dark colours simple recognisable shapes
round it's always fun to have something take a plastic is the best with rubber of wood or titanium Would also be a bit weird
properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material it was a good idea to use the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights we have to incorporate slides
thousand and four you can't put something on the market which is on the ground
energy source i've got a lot of possibilities And lcd was a possibility for the remote control
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
warm use my pen anymore so be it just ordinary keyboard
sell and then tie a title for programme or at least at a quite large part of it and then you get a very large lcd screen on top and when you have a table for more than two weeks she just gets annoying because it still be too flashy
remind like takes place of the of of specifics piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity thing is just the shape should be for today this is fruit just round shapes
Drawl really nicely of the best we can put the logo and all that back
trendy too because that's the mode it it's a it's icsi a extent when you go to the living room
time you would have teletext and the menu nowadays to access the screen settings
drop it if you drop it back began a resolution with it the goal is backs industry a day when you're gonna something's
ia is still don't have any information back to the rc
skip the house as easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple electronic all chip is available with the led transmission or a transmitter
gotta find a balance of the minutes are very hard to read somewhere that i've got some fate fees
fruit is a yellow and black and white that's on the old grey
fond of of fronts like we can use on the telephone
