hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons would recharge the battery
lots of buttons for all the features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the television be control for your remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel flipping and then the other white
intrigued by the idea of the scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast
button to switch off in case out of plastic them the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery
decided on like a simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip depending
tend to watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv and the button to changing the brightness on trying to see it happening
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery although there are slight complications with solar battery
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
round remote instead of like a rubber button down one like in terms of holding it like that so if she to a fruit and vegetables have to haul
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end up with the device going to work together on a model using modelling clay
concept of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface and we'll come back to the chip
international be on we said but for all age groups different functions to keep the remote from getting lost a large buttons for the essential functions a possibility for extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information i have no idea how much more expensive than a regular battery
double curved is like like two sides that curve gonna make one curve of a case we could do a flat which flat case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved case or it maybe even a double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
number of different choices for a design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
kinda like in the idea of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard plastic inside it just cover with the latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
hit my understanding of old latex cases that it's hard to protect the circuit board
list a matter how many buttons we have are in have like black with red sit there and stand control the television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the real materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
designer of our real reaction company that i there are what we have to stress fashion watchers in paris and milan comments on some things that are gonna be go on this year
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
fickle a or latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
