time more couple of some of the features of that potential funky looking remote control starts beeping this is a way of find the remote you do need my income like we need the book then control
button if you press the button there are that are more to start beeping so with the remote control and they need exposing these are the three scroll buttons are in the shape of fruits these buttons
findings is uses would be really interested in a look at the doing to find that the shape of a fruit upload banana Shaped object
hold like the way you the end of the banana it's it's saying like if that seems a bit like an e a few people would really wanna banana
design and you have to work on the user should it should be already p define
powerful are powered by a man though it's a device on the fruit or you want to some like fruit but a different fruit for kids
conversation with the coffee machine that that with producing is you can say good morning how would you like a coffee
norway with with buttons i have to be at some point of the banana you wanna of holders may you may be one of the whole like a gun know and you don't have to point toward the fall
bite the things that by nine that and the base a station is nothing more just it's that by which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket
technology that we can add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech since the since it's speech not really speech recognition is even if we can do it it's not really appropriate for a television and running
important to have two scroll-wheels because you want one for the channel we also want one for the volume up volume is it's it's very handy for it to have the instant feedback and response
received an email i'll and lunchtime they know that the bring in mind to the technology division has developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit
rising is a factor for us that so we'll go for the regular chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana that advanced chip
unique problem with television's is that if you have this got this scroll-wheel for the television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll and then just ways that station
basis a extra for the functionality is such as the wheels the speaker you need so that in on the list but the device that may be difficult to can have to build
plastic as a thing is that most appropriate one it'll ring the cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production components
importance from leicester more important is that People or nineteen ninety five percent of young people are worse
soundtrack for the kid is the design of the hand a hundred
beep or people are more the devastating never find a fancy look-and-feel instead of a instead of the car and The car and train which was for the functional look and feel so old now More more core aspect not more hard core that aspect rather than a devise ways to many phones times on many buttons
advanced technology lcd has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out so it's the basic
combination just to train it's not the law and channel four hundred channels you have to be a tool to recognise
real recognise i he was but he was in a set not like a freight you train it for a certain for a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back the phrase in response
eugene In the eighties and he back to the minutes of the last meeting we should take a decision on that point
easier to do a banana and plastic you can have the book but the side not the materials like wood that's got a grinding you put some of an agenda
city's would not be possible to implement it for the next prototype
break so you'd have to worry too much about the case the chip then if it's too far away from a the casing was the casing is too thick then you may not hear the the speaker
shape if you'd and not be out the door probably you may as do it in a style as way that just looks a bit more twenty first century route and sixties and seventies
cells and the lighting conditions are good that can be useful it'd be pretty in a week
ripple it's all the ideas we've had we had doing these presentations just to draw some sketch about so which would be the pro the final product and that were part
set it that's a switch with the double curve would actually menu and you could like drawer something on on the whiteboard
