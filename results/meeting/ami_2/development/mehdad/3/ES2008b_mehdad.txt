sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different at the types of user who's controlling the chip through the use of the user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
users using a remote control so it's one has got lots of buttons and that might be older people
includes an emphasis on making the infrared very functional requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled That extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design of the remote control
shared a quite a bit rate anyone wants to work design they need to be figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
focusing on the designers people maybe people who have problem with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
Space is similar to a very basic weapons you have like you have number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people don't wanna be changing
people are only using ten percent of that they would be willing to buy a new remote all they want like an upgrade
sense we're gonna have to aim for a design which is fairly conventional in design it's gonna be crucial
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume changing the channel settings
age so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or adjust
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls in the analysing
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicate like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
talk about our functions and our target group that means that is very few we need to each group
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d data is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared bulb which will then bring
components that we find here are the energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data to the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data and presents a while without strips gathering
aiming for a technological advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
finally it is more marketing our corporate image has to be recognisable
prominent as the main features and price as you mentioned something called rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest one and half people's problems
short amount of time you get specific in crap instruction manual it comes at the end of the spectrum
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
Switch the quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
