push buttons would recharge the battery
user remotes you press the buttons are fun
keeping a very small and simple set of buttons remain things but then i go back
lots of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
buttons could be shaped like different fruits
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control
buttons changing the volume favourite channels is applicable
ipods and things right now have touch scroll wheel
simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip depending
lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
case the buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main this'll be plastic
people when i watch tv in the dark
idea of the kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches
ri uses for buttons to me to move around so range of settings so on a small lcd display on the device
model is a going to be for user interface list of device
television send information back to the remote control list a matter how many buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting
solar battery although there are slight complications with solar battery
member of that this is the device this is an ipod from apple
international be on we said but for all age groups different functions to keep the remote from getting lost a large buttons for the essential functions a possibility for extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv
minutes a new type things you look and feel design meeting and it's sending
spongy latex it's a spongy is the end
changeable covers like for your mobile in different fruit and vegetable colours we could colour
point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find a way to protect like the chip
interface and we'll come back to the chip
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
plastic but we have all these fashion in technological elements we can add in the word latex titanium or rubber or other coloured types of plastic inside it just cover with the latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
fifty minutes left of the meeting
fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
designer of our real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
simple regular advanced chip-on-print as that machine prince on the wires and source
work together on a prototype using modelling clay
mind that these are the options that we have for manufacturing
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford
