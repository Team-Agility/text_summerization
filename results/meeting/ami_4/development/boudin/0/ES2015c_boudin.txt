research team of phones and in new multiple all options scroll buttons or just the push button
sales plan to say and the remote control test
agenda for this so this particular meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface
lighting in the buttons so one same colour just to keep it to the simplest o'clock
actual remote would be hard plastic with rubber plate going on top
lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat then i got like on a cell phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons that actually that control controls that are behind the rubber
confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost of buttons functions will show
command interface requires you to type text role commands that the user uses to control its operation and input at the keyboard so the numbers
User interface design an hour more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons
buttons are you don't necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user interfaces to stick graphical
wise kinetic energy is transformed into a power
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
buttons you would have the power channels volume
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television that people have in the kitchen
difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates in this meeting and like sticks that fruits
end so more internal casing is that would be were rubber encapsulate in all of these Chips and diodes and delicate technology
Pop in tarot will have to work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
concert a one point device that doesn't include
strip it down to like really basic shape
important aspect is that the remote control should be easy
called medium or regular chip was supposed to simple
weapon for the simple the weight that was the advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house cat our dog
reconvene in thirty minutes will be meeting
recent fashion update to have a quite a fashion watchers in paris and milan is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
lee back inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
main internal feature it is a circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
keyboard so the numbers are like a keyboard you pressing
method was mainly web-based research this time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
store we see the relief of displayed
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting the interior lighting system
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint in a trying call
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
settings was use zero point five times an hour
looked at the design reports from previous years here real swimming or a store
stick to tv based maybe tv in the dark
popular thing we came up out of your market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates are busily to keep in mind
