important still what so what functions there are we want to put in the remote control
base or we could like make up a button and if you push it the remote i've got some images of remote controls in the world
issue we implement features that of functions we want to implement doesn't really matter
compliment area remote and the universe want if you want to keep it simple word that they won't use the remote control with only basic tv functions
remote control should only be used for television otherwise the project becomes more complex which endangers time lot of time to market
elderly you are willing to spend more money on a remote control it's basic remote controls
functions more buttons maybe it's come becoming less trendy look all the all seven percent of the market is consists of elderly people at who don't really care for trendy look so whatever i it can do no harm to make a trendy for the other thirty percent
import because we gonna make such a basic remote control is nothing special ed for twenty five euros
case of this simple remote control the technical problems i have and digitise the last meeting minutes
hundreds or one hundred people are How do you say watched using remote controls and usability lab
open it may be contains some future date you don't normally linked to the remote control i have most of the hour
discussion the distinctions in what cut and no that just in functions for other maybe for other quick madonna but just the basic functions it's very important to find
detailed functions regarding the tv set on your remote controller with two audio settings and a screen settings sound settings which are not very often used We could group them one button And and make them accessible in one menu button
fifty percent says they only use ten percent of the buttons on the remote control very often in the room
implement too much features on on our remote control because the elderly people will that last group features for a higher usability lab and they also fill out a questionnaire with a few questions
energy it activated chip in the remote control is electrical circuit board are one of the side
lights also around the volume should we do we make them very big buttons flashy design And maybe some cages
company already cells remote control to older people but we also want a new customer group but isn't that for more person you our corporate image should stay recognisable in our product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty
electrical circuit Which compose messages in the form of infrared signals And the television and there is not the right combination
tune to skip is the pear we did recharge its own never have the battery that's one fattening
Relevance options are power buttons are used four hundred and sixty eight times per hour channel selection
talk about the working design of the shape or some gauge it's future work that out stepping
simple design and no other functions and just if you but taste do aim at the younger format
functions shane it's one when we get a user requirements of the new pretty i was told
show you some of the new project requirements the account manager send me there are contradicting
production someone so one time goes by and i never put them in a recharger of thing last one often that put it on site
