sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control is a device that simple
mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled That extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design presentation and the functional requirements
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy into data
lots of buttons and that might be older people maybe people specified problem right now is that people's remote
chip through the use of the user interface is for this product
record the frequency that they use particular buttons and the relevant the polls buttons with essentials
combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
Space is similar to a very basic weapons you have like you have numbers and sports colours
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people
focusing on the designers people specifically said that it's not remotes were ugly seventy
audio setting is then given it much important and visibility on the remote as a minute channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the volume people
money to buy a new remote all they want like an upgrade
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
web to to see if i could find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find a balance between features and price
voice recognition was inverse be related to age so younger people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice activation
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
control in this index opinions on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or focused
components that we find here are the energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
work or infrared bulb which will then bring
deadline the target group that means that is very few we need to each group
finally it is more marketing our corporate image has to be recognisable
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest frustration
backwards up down channel numbers volume freeze frame
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
instruction manual it comes at the end of select other than just media but code
price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
short amount of time you get specific in crap instructions from your personal coach emailed
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
prominent as the main features and price as you mentioned something called rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range of ages
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
