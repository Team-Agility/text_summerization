asked real people who are using real remote controlled every day and or any other to me that you see that the remote control
easy colour that we don't usually see the remote controls they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
general people change tv more often than batteries on their remote control
remote control we should be easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
remote controls and speech recognition you want the radios
simple buttons and speech recognition technology
futuristic hear it would control with angles and the titanium back and not to look at a new remote controls it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a i'll put that says creaky what they are actions
distinctive look and feel and you look they do Which people use need to the trains if we were in the world as our company
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and batteries for Really like batteries and we will good price
simple to program where the chip technology and it's more expensive
location and these people are really interesting on those features
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology
Generally add developed quite a broad concept of the interface but for Possible instruction or users many all and so all that complex saying so it's come together with your tv and remote controls
flat different colours Depending on what is around like what colours around and depending on the temperature
ready in the post and down to locate then we have to go for some speaker
technology and so that we can have Enough space or enough money are you don't and you're out of business
follow smart should be some not too complicated
colours they can be more money too bad These And the shapes and then they can have different assembly
titanium smelling like fruit or do we make spongy on one that animal A chip
chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive they feel is colour lcd screen was different colours
important to be fancy have to have a fancy look-and-feel and then interestingly
story that for the point before why not the rubber is expensive
solar cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy would solar cells hand too late to just use simple battery
problem is that this design we phone that we can't use the double record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
criterion the trends that we seen big cities like paris and milan it seems that this year think it should have a fruit these teams like fruits and vegetables and spongy
lighting we have many options in the market
straight on these individual action g which are for them ram out a bit design
include video i was d display for the tv you information
remember has a nokia phone which changeable panels
dark blue who are watching the trends there inventing it You're creating the trend i hope
decision we want to take on this meeting are on the them first and component concept so what energy we use what chip on print and one cat case
big and there's so i'm just asking them the current trends according to them when the going to store is that when they asked there are friends mine has this and that euros And finally
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
work together a menu on a prototype using modelling clay
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that mark and then sandy
sammy the product evaluation
puts lots of concentrate
