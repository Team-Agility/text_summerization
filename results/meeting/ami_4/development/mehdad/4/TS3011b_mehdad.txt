lots of people complain they kind can find your remote control button remote control function
user interface i come up with And easy remote control is just a function of remote control
power buttons and use one time and the volume
easier way of a round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote controls the multi function and remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling in touching the buttons
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to switch to to channels when you have something and channel four n something on channel switching
stick for volume control and channel selection is the most important function In one button
functions and the money that we can say from that we should use for having a design and thinking about the user interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
save costs by not implementing a lot of function and can be implemented in in our design will become more complicated
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
list of Functions do you want an explicit list which include all function available device
important button And there are lots of people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control
numbers about the speech recognition here that's younger people do not always want to use the voice
dec design we can make a design of this piece of equipment that's not a moderate
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set would have such a device you would have to walk you tv
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy on the inside or elaborate on your opinion
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons you have that's the cheaper that the chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find the finding function
focusing on younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost and things like that battery lifetime energy saving another advantage
user interface connect to chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
hope personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten digits but keep the program
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound from other sounds
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition the data
market is interested in some advanced new technique a used in this equipment
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume and the programme one and some fancy light and techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
cell phone just one like in the device which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger part is forty percent of the market
top goal of this meeting is to reach call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product on the target group and the functions of the remote control
generates a few times within that a certain period of time to perform are individual work i have no time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
older you might want to constrain that portion market would respond to a simple
summary of all things are spoken and the different concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
components which can zoom far less power saving will be a bit more difficult so we can expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
case we have to metal contacts
slight problem I opened the cd rom box accidentally
