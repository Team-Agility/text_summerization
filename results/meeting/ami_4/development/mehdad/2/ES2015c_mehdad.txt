research team of phones and in new multiple all choice scroll buttons or just the push button
live up to our purpose of having a very fashionable remote control concept and how we're gonna make a what it really is and that thing the meeting
depending on what kinds of the design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface
lighting in the buttons so one same colour it's face could have its own colour of button
actual remote would be hard plastic and put it in rubber or plastic
lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat then i got like on a cell phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons that actually that control controls that are behind the rubber
confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost of buttons functions will show
decided that the command line interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
complicated and the controls would be more user friendly remote control that a lot of interface design so those are the trendy and we still have the money
brings it thing we need to be recharged and the bulk the size
aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point device
lots of different possibilities for the energy you don't need an x then also the battery supply all solar energy source idea that's been used by some watches and that devices where you just shake in the device and it gives it to power to make a circuit
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
symbol of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power which we've been sitting inside a building
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television will have the option of like people room style movie style
difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates in this meeting and like sticks that fruits
sie it's like at the same rubber coating which is on the casing is that would be were rubber encapsulate in all of these Chips and diodes and delicate technology
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop in tarot will have to work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
silly if we do point to have anything else just have to not important
strip it down to like really basic shape
important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be technologically innovative and hope
called so it's a medium or regular chip was supposed to simple
separate apart from the chip which will probably decide whether we buy a simple the weight that was the advanced technology
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
recent fashion update to have a quite a fashion watchers in paris and milan is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
components of the circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at ed
keyboard so the numbers are like a keyboard you pressing
amount of time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
advanced would have to go with a lcd c Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television
pushing the light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint i can't remember what it's got at the components
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
audio settings was use zero point five times an hour
looked at the design report from previous years here real swimming or a store
stick to tv based maybe tv in the dark
popular thing we came up out of your market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates are busily to keep in mind
