televisions that we have the remote control supplied as you can do the buttons with a one and a dash into a dash but when you use but the remote control hasn't got too much redundant or i needed buttons
remote control because you always will pick up the remote control in remote controls not be how do you feel
remote control gives a signal at the one button on the remote control within five seconds
deem them must be innovative technology for remote control
big deal but the remote control gets why did a state
push button it sends it immediately to the television you have to a click on a a special button on it would like one and then a dash it's the same thing as when you just push the one you can show on the telly it a one and just that there's no way it's it's it's a cat
talk about the docking station would be a fifth of the price of the remote control
buttons special colour or give them a special colour things have to be marked v because that's what we were planning
point out which is the volume and button and which is the programme button supplements we'll give the buttons we place them in the middle the menu and for the teletext
imagine that would be impossible to make a docking station for two euros and thirty cents
special we looked at the form material also because of rubber
open the specially them all gonna work
docking station and cost and such are not included in this list
docking station and probably we also have only we also need a simple chip but when we put in the speaker and the retriever a device it will costa a bit more like a high in the advanced chip in a sense
Schematic few of the remote control what nothing about the advanced chip but the scroll wheel in it requires you if you vision
function tv functionality of that's a separate button when you wanna find
side that will be a strip of rubber and in the middle
sense the fifty cents a button
case a low for a remote control is at least one euro
buttons will be that will be matching colour for the plastic ago what colour for the rubber on the side
battery one battery the reason we don't need kinetic thing we could do to do a compromise in which you can kinetic
remote controls that down at these buttons but you still can know you can still select the twenty a number in the twenty times an hour
positive things has to be on the left so i said not oddly instead of lively
button you give one signal and the older television need to be input first nn
score higher on innovative technology some is this if it was impossible
rubber parts and it's the readiness of thing and then when you move the round a lot then people find it really are doing in other people find the id funny for a week i something like that where you have to move my remote control rounded
excel in on the in the range in the field of design and these forget the drawing skills
calculator also works on our own solar cells more projects than only remote controls
middle there's hard to hard material have a hard plastic with a light on the top or the buttons they can make lights
power cable with a buttons on it We do retrieval a device is very cheap that's just a regular
question is usable it will be bought by people under the age of forty
call a lot of problems The sample sensor sample speaker
evaluate that design According to a few points out we can place all on top
eighty percent of the price of of the amount of button you have to put it in a carton board
leave the retrieve in such a side will give it a more less ugly or side
lowest part of it so when it's the same as the other products go deeper
important part of these meeting
