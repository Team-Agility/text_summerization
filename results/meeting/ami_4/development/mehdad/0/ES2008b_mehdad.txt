sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
talk about the technical functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy going to the user
appeal to people specified problem with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons that they have offered to them on the remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people losing it too if it's the it's a fun
chip through the use of the user interface the user interface concept market trend were watching
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and the relevant the polls buttons with essentials
combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work design presentation i have a pet
Space is similar to a very basic weapons you have like you have number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people don't wanna be changing
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design it's gonna be crucial
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume changing the channel settings
importantly though eighty percent of that they would be willing to pick up the remote all they want like an upgrade
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
web to to see if i could find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find a way of striking a balance between features and price
age so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
button on the television and the power which complicate
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
talk about the new project requirements that people satisfied
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
question earlier on whether this is going to be to for television dv or in it that are just a television that or adjust
components that we find here are the energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data and presents a while without strips gathering
receiver and in my opinion infrared bulb which will then bring
talk about our functions and our target group that means that is very few we need to each group
marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d data is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest frustration
backwards up down channel numbers volume freeze frame
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
instruction manual it comes at the end of the spectrum
price limit of the twelve and a half euro to produce
aiming for a technological advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
prominent as the main features and price as you mentioned something called rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
Switch the quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
