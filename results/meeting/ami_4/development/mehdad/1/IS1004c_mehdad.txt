conversation with the coffee machine that that with producing is you can say good morning how would you like a coffee
concentrating on like a fruit or you want to some like fruit but a different fruit for each device
decided not to go for speech recognition technology just because of some reasons and all honesty
rising is a factor for us that so we'll go for the regular chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana that advanced chip
worth but it doesn't really add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech since the since it's speech not really speech recognition is even if we can do it it's not really appropriate for a television and running
bite the things that by nine that and the base a station is nothing more just it's that by which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket
received an email i'll and lunchtime they know that the bring in mind to the technology division has developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit
find that the shape of a fruit which is handy feature
norway with with buttons i have to be at some point without worrying too much about how to develop
basis a extra for the functionality is such as the wheels the speaker you need so that in on the list but the device
unique problem with television's is that if you have this got this scroll-wheel for the television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll and then just ways that station

real recognise i he was but he was in a set not like a freight you train it for a certain for a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back the phrase in response
sense that you can recognise a set it that's a switch with the double curve would actually menu and you could like drawer something on on the whiteboard
clarify this these questions that they had in the meeting a few minutes
speaker is actually on the chip then if it's too far away from a the casing was the casing is too thick then you may not hear is concerned are we can have some gap so you'd have to worry too much about the case been broken is the inside
city's would not be possible to implement it for the next prototype
shape if you'd and not be out the door probably you may as do it in a style as way that just looks a bit more twenty first century route and sixties and seventies
