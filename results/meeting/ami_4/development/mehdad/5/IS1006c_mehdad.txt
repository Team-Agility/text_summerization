asked real people who are using real remote controlled every day and or any other to me that you see that the remote control but it seems that's so important but it's used as a remote control
easy to use as a remote control they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
general people change tv more often than batteries on their remote control
remote control we should be easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
device on that can be used for speech recognition technology we take at least five euros or that you put some control we want to reduce
simple button and speech recognition technology
marriage are all The Brawl the way of saying the thing if we look back and not to look at a new remote controls it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a i'll put that says creaky what they are actions
distinctive look and feel and you look they do Which people use need to the trains if we were in the people want to be different from their friends
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and battery and also we want to go for titanium design we should of rub
simple to program where the chip do we have only the plastic or that cd five or a chip
location and these people are really interesting on those features or they really like They're more want these fancy features
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser but we want to goals speaker independent or speaker dependent
Generally add developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface but for Possible instruction or users many all and so all that complex saying so it's come together with your tv and remote controls
flat different colours Depending on what is around like what colours around and depending on the temperature
ready in the post and down to locate then we have to go for some speaker
sixty then you make a lot of money are you don't and you're out of business
plastic we stick with two batteries solar smart
colours they can be more money too bad These And the shapes and then they can have different assembly
choose that titanium smelling like fruit or do we make spongy on one that animal A chip
chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive they feel is colour lcd screen was different colours
interestingly this is the very most important thing it has to be fancy then to be with an that's the second thing you'd have to be it has to be technologically you do the tv
story that for the point before why not the rubber i some rubber parts
propose but the use of solar cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy would solar cells hand too late to just use simple battery
problem is that this design we phone that we can't use the double record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
criterion the trends that we seen big cities like paris and milan it seems that this year think it should have a fruit and vegetable thing fruit and vegetable and spongy
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
straight on these individual action g which are for them ram out a bit design meeting
interface there to use pushbuttons or you could just read it cd display for the tv you information
remember has a nokia phone we can use the phone as a good to Example of work to it beeps back
small recap on how do we watch the trends there inventing it You're creating the trend i hope i'm going to try to help you want that this is more risky
decision we want to take on this meeting are on the them first and component concept so what energy and the media and the interface for energy
oscillating if you put bar it's a big and there's so i'm just asking them the current trends according to them when the going to store is that when they asked there are friends mine has this and that euros And finally
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
work together a menu on a prototype using modelling clay
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that Mark and then sandy
sammy the product evaluation
puts lots of concentrate
