grip a places in the remote control you have your hand on one place on a remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb So in that case that's the most common remote control
possibility for us to use scroll bar the scroll wheels that's the speaker the speech recognition the rubber The fancy colours
cd displays there's no way you can integrated scroll wheel there's no scenario way you use at the button in the scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons you can as you scroll wheels
case of the volume button is on the side or the side but do you touch
market would like something titanium casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved
interface we can have a high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
note if you want to use these rubber with one curve which is curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular an advanced functions we can keep with a simple a chip which is a bit cheaper
flawless Think about a scenario where you would use the scroll buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch
discussion the digits six on the bus and it will disappear when it's from rubber of the case
customers specifically ask for the spongy feel you need to to make it buttons all of rubber
colours are really what are young people likes a more colourful ones and a very traditional call cover with such an image
issue i addressed at the beginning of the meeting the voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
older group a step further dark colours simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
suggest we use the sensor sample the sample sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip i fault
colours is to back and white forearm i had a market is decide as a little older
grey in yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours are great and yellow
colouring is important but innovation is more important than Ease of use for the our target group like fruit and vegetables In their clothes shoes and furniture
talk about all the different components wire in this design and it's too dull
low again always late Point i would like to some issues that would like to point
forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic cover with the rubber finishing this is what's on the edge what you feel
latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cell solution for the energy source is the battery and the solar
kinetic thing it is it's possibility is more sense of it and you can store
watching tv when you have to make some energy supply at the very little amount of kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it's against the wall
cost rating on the young group like from a material
imagine it's very goal to talk to a device with you have two points to another device
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar panel and hand dynamo
space in our finance i would say do integrate some functions
watch you watch a movie and you haven't channel you have chosen like that often the amount of energy then the shaking of your body which is all was every actively make body shake it charges
program it you musically you give and And action with which you believe it is you use a mute function
indicators we have the lcd displays
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
difference between a sense than direct the version of the advanced a version of the chip supports lcd that's all and we've decided
lcs ids at this is what this is my personal preference but i bet i understood that the market situation
carpets on the wall which are natural of mean friends
cable go back in thirty minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
talk with our manufacturing division is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion questions
