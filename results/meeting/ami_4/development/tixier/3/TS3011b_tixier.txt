lots of people complain they kind can find the remote control button you press
user interface i come up with And easy remote control is just a function of remote
power buttons and use one time and the volume
easier way of a round button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
multi function and remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to switch the channel
relevance scale the channel selection is the most important function In one button
interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
implementing a lot of function and can be implemented in in our design
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
list of Functions do you want an explicit list which include all function available device
important button And there are lots of people is that there's a central point is that we really should use energy sparse friendly components
volume because maybe people do not always want to use the voice
dec design we can make a design of this piece of equipment that's not a moderate
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set would have such a device controls
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy on the inside or elaborate on your opinion
chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find
focusing on younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
Combined with the low cost if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
user interface connect to chip which is connected to the sender which generates
personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten percent the buttons
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
market is interested in some advanced technique a used in this equipment
hands like a turning on and off the light and techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
cell phone just one like in the device which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
bought by people younger than they have forty percent of the market
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our product cost rr in just a part of the equipment
time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
older you might want to constrain that portion market would respond to a simple
summary of all things are spoken and the different concept we discuss
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
power saving will be a bit more difficult so we can expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
case we have to metal contacts
slight problem I opened the cd rom box accidentally
