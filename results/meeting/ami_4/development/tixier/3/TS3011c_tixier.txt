personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control a yellow
possibility for us to use scroll wheels i also have some information
scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons you can as you scroll wheels
volume button and either on the side or the side a of remote control would be perfect
market would like something titanium casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved
high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
note if you want to use these rubber with one curve User
phase source and is the design of the look and feel The user interface controls
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular
buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch
discussion the digits six on the bus and it will disappear when it's from rubber of the case
spongy feel you need to to make it buttons all of rubber
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
issue i addressed at the beginning of the meeting the voice recognition
older group a step further dark colours simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
suggest we use the sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip
colours is to back and white forearm i had a market is decide as a little older
yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours
Ease of use for the our target group like fruit and vegetables are important
talk about all the different components wire in this design and it's too dull
Point i would like to some issues that would like to point
forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic
latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cell solution for the energy
kinetic thing it is it's possibility is more sense of it and you can store
mine doesn't have kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it's against the wall
cost rating on the young group like from a material
imagine it's very goal to talk to a device with you have two points to another device
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar panel and hand dynamo
space in our finance i would say do integrate some functions
watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of time Any wanted to switch the channel
piece of this action with which you believe it is you use a mute
indicators we have the lcd displays
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
version of the advanced a version of the chip supports lcd that's all and we've decided
lcs ids at this is what this is my personal preference but i bet i understood that the market
carpets on the wall which are natural of mean friends
back in thirty minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
talk with our manufacturing division is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion
