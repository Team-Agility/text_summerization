designing a new television remote control what we want to do it sends a message
talk about the technical functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design of the remote control
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
appeal to people are only using ten percent of the buttons
designing several different at the types of user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
control so it's one has got lots of buttons hired
parts of the work design they need to be figured
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy to granting the beans
pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
people are so is that like change the channel and changing the volume
importantly though eighty percent of that they would be willing to pick up the remote
button on the tv you can press the middle ring
economic we need to find a way of striking a balance
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition
button on the television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
working sanders figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that just received
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television
battery and that that the chip and convert that much data
receiver and in my opinion infrared bulb which will then bring
target group that means that is very few we need to each group
marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d data is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the people mention that was the biggest
backwards up down channel numbers volume freeze frame
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
number to make it technologically the end of the spectrum
price limit of the twelve and a half euro to produce
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
short amount of time you'll be able to access more of the website
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
