research team of phones and in new multiple all options scroll buttons or just the push button
test will have to look at how the remote control
depending on what kinds of the design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
lighting in the buttons and face could have its own colour of button
plastic and put it in rubber plate going on top
lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat
confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost of buttons functions will show
command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
complicated and the controls would be more user friendly remote control that a lot of interface
brings it thing we need to be recharged and the bulk the size
graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point
kinetic energy is transformed into a power to make a circuit
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
symbol of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television
difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
casing and the rubber would just be that what's in contact with the human eye
working this have to shake it a bit and revitalise
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
silly if we do point to have anything else just have to not important
strip it down to like really basic shape
important aspect is that the remote control should be easy
regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
separate apart from the chip which will probably decide whether we buy a simple the weight that was the advanced technology
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
fruits and vegetable things if that's going to work for us sound
contrast to last in the feel the material is expected to be spongy
circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at ed
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
amount of time lcd type of buttons we have an input
Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television
diodes transistors resonators resistors and passes it could pass it is all need to be considered
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentation
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
audio settings was use zero point five times an hour
looked at the design report from previous years ago the ousted
stick to tv based maybe tv in the dark
popular thing we came up out of your market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates are busily to keep in mind
