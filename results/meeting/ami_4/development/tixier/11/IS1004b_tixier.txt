research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech recognition
time corporate to do with the remote control you start and then you stop
focusing on television but still like a universal remote control or is this something for a reminder of televisions
people want to be l to find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
feed the targets in front of cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
point because actually having all that some of the remotes out there this is quite although our price
priced a remote control it would really be worth us on that would be worth implementing
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen just for changing channel numbers easily
limiting the number of buttons but what each of those button to enter to do and then the summer
speech recognition technology does mean sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find
work it does work was supposed to work on and so on the working design issues
study with for incorporation of new technologies for young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
contacts with people and tv or we have control of the tv to superimpose that is this menu
pretty wide range of remote control shouldn't be very they have looked pretty comfortable if you want to get this and on top
simplest thing the remote to change the lights and i close the windows what about the heating
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
programmes on off and you what channel already what's on If you have a list
cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
idea but as a marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition
buttons it increases the difficulty of find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
working design is so user interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak
screen except for the really main functions which have a couple of the round device down to a minimum but not quite that interfere with the functionality of the device
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press a button
focus more on the internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
programme you could have a start time for me to to bring you to some new way you informations
teletext but we want to get read one of four requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
seoul extend past the hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should be similar to the traditional
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting there on the remote control
easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
live in a little in each of the the main formations on the tv that we can work with and grab information
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
forces you had a company which is putting the fashion in electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
mount the for the naming we see fault for the look-and-feel later so let's go for this representation
average then quincy off by some bottom
