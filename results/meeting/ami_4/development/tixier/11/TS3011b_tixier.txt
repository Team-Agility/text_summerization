video sets and and there's a special button that find your remote control button you press
method of the remote control so we might want to build in the future to support them Some audio signal like one phones
power buttons and use one time and the volume
easier way of a round button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
multi function and remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to switch the channel or to not the volume
stick for volume control and channel selection you have them to most important function In one button
user interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
implementing a lot of function and can be implemented in in our design will become more complicated
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
buttons for the advanced other Functions do you want an explicit list which include all function available device
important button And there are lots of people is that there's a central point is that we really should use energy sparse friendly components
numbers about the speech recognition here that's younger people do not always want to use the voice
dec design we can make a design of this piece of equipment that's not a moderate
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv and press that device you would have to walk you tv
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy on the inside or elaborate on your opinion
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find the one solution
focusing on younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the cost circuit board
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
hope personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound from other sounds
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
market is interested in some advanced new technique a used in this equipment
hands like a turning on and off the light and techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
cell phone just one like in the device which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger part is forty percent of the market
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our product cost rr in just a part of the equipment
generates a few times within that a certain period of time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
older you might want to constrain that portion market would respond to a simple
summary of all things are spoken and the different concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
power saving will be a bit more difficult so we can expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
case we have to metal contacts
slight problem I opened the cd rom box accidentally
