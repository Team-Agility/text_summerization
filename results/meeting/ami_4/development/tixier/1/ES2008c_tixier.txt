economics it's probably better to push buttons would recharge the battery
box is where you press the centre button
keeping a very small and simple set of button to switch off in case you get bored
lots of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu
shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
people to be able to use it as a remote control
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel
intrigued by the idea of the scroll buttons to scroll
decided on like a simple a regular chip
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen
case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
tend to watch tv i them wanting to say on the tv
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display
concept of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface
list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
member of that this is the device going to work
determine what the essential functions of the device
curve of a case we could do a flat which flat case the curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv
fun doing it components design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
shaped like a vegetable colours we could colour
find a way to protect like the chip
interface and we'll come back to the chip
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
number of different choices for a design concept and start
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
minute or if you the minutes left of the meeting
fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
research has been carried out by real reaction company wind focus on fashion
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
work together on a prototype using modelling clay
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre
