personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control
possibility for us to use scroll scroll wheel
scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons
volume button is on the side or the side
casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved
interface we can have a high-tech in buttons
note if you want to use these rubber with one curve User
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular
buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch
fronts On which the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber
spongy feel you need to to make it buttons all of rubber
colours it should be a full colour cover
issue i addressed at the beginning of the meeting the voice recognition

watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of volume
piece of this action to it's that's really the mute
indicators we have the lcd displays
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
version of the advanced a version of the chip supports lcd that's all and we've decided
understood there are some significant changes in the market
carpets on the wall which are natural of mean friends
bright anything down could you put it on the shared folder
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
talk with our manufacturing department is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion
