personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control
possibility for us to use scroll wheels they can be handy
scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons you can as you scroll wheels
volume button and either on the side a of remote control would be perfect
casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved
high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
note if you want to use these rubber with one curve User
phase source and is the design of the look and feel an internet
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular
buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch
fronts On which the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber
spongy feel you need to to make it buttons all of rubber
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
issue i addressed at the beginning of the meeting the voice recognition item we were searching for this sample
older group a step further dark colours simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
regular chip for the sample sensor so if you say mute
read that the market is decide as a little older
yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours
important but innovation is more important than Ease of use for the our target group like fruit and vegetables In their clothes shoes and furniture
stick with the simple as straightforward and not curve design
Point i would like to some issues that would like to point
forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic
latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cell solution for the energy
move that's the sense of it and you can store
problem here is that it's supply at the very little amount of kinetic energy
cost rating on the young group like from a material
imagine it's very goal to talk to a device with you have two points to another device
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar
space in our finance i would say do integrate some functions
watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of time Any wanted to switch the channel
piece of this action to it's that's really the mute
indicators we have the lcd displays
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
version of the advanced a version of the chip supports lcd that's all and we've decided
understood there are some significant changes in the market situation
carpets on the wall which are natural of mean friends
cable go back in thirty minutes you will have a prototype
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
talk with our manufacturing division is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion
