cost we should just go for push buttons would recharge the battery
press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
keeping a very small and simple set of button to switch off in case you get bored
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu
buttons could be shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
people to be able to use it as a remote control concepts
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel flipping and then the other white
intrigued by the idea how much more expensive a scroll buttons to scroll
decided on like a simple a regular chip to keep our costs
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
case out of plastic them the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery
tend to watch tv i them wanting to say on the tv
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display
properties of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface
television send information back to the remote control list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
member of that this is the device that is going to be useful to people
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
hurt you say have one case probably with a variety of design elements
features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv
fun doing it components design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours we could colour
point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find a way to protect the circuit board
interface and we'll come back to the chip
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard plastic
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
fashion and simplicity and easy to use is necessarily the right drinking personally
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
research has been carried out by real reaction company wind focus on fashion
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
