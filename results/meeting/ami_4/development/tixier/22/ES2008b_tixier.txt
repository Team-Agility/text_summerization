sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control
talk about the technical functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design of the remote control
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
appeal to people are only using ten percent of the buttons and that might be older people
designing several different at the types of user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and the relevant the polls buttons
easiest thing to do is gonna be work design presentation i have a pet
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
people are so is that like change the channel and changing the volume people
importantly though eighty percent of that they would be willing to buy a new remote
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
web to to see if i could find a way of striking a balance
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition but at the price

working sanders figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television screen just and some text things and they looking graphics
battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data
receiver and in my opinion infrared bulb which will then bring
grew in a group that means that is very few we need to each group
finally it is more marketing our corporate image has to be recognisable
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d data is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
backwards up down channel numbers volume freeze frame
uh_huh fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
worry about four minutes i emailed them to you and also putting on them in the shared folder
instruction manual it comes at the end of select other than just media but code
price limit of the twelve and a half euro to produce
aiming for a technological advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
