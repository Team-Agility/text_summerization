cost we should just go for push buttons which is what real reaction
hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
keeping a very small and simple set of button to switch off in case you get bored
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu button so that we can access
buttons could be shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel flipping and then the other white
intrigued by the idea of the scroll an actual i got ipods scroll button
chip we can have a simple one a regular chip to keep our costs
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
case out of plastic them the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons
tend to watch tv i them wanting to say on the tv and watch
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
concept of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface list of device
list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
member of that this is the device that is going to be useful to people
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
curve of a case we could do a flat which flat case the curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv
fun doing it components design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
ideas had it possibly use these and how to use a fruit and vegetables have to haul
point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find a way to protect the circuit board
interface and we'll come back to the chip
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
sending it out's only fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these question on the weight of these different elements
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options that we have for manufacturing
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
