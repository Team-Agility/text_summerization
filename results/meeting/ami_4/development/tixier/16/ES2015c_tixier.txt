research team of phones and in new multiple all options scroll buttons or just the push button
back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control
depending on what kinds of the design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
lighting in the buttons so one same colour just to keep it to the simplest o'clock
clip on plastic and put it in rubber can get on top or would stay
lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat
confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost of buttons functions will show
decided that the command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
complicated and the controls would be more user friendly remote control that a lot of interface
buttons are you don't necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point
lots of different possibilities for the energy is transformed into a power to make a circuit
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
symbol of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television will have the option of like people room style movie remote
difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
casing and the rubber would just be that what's in contact with the human eye
solar power not maybe not working this have to shake it a bit and revitalise
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
silly if we do point to have anything else just have to not important
strip it down to like really basic shape
important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be technologically innovative
meet so it's a medium or regular chip was supposed to simple
separate apart from the chip which will probably decide whether we buy a simple regular advanced
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
due to the fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for a remote control
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at ed
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
amount of time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
advanced would have to go with a lcd c Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual components so we'd have to get it in separately
diodes transistors resonators resistors and passes it could pass it is all need to be considered
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentation
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
audio settings was use zero point five times an hour
shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real
stick to tv based maybe tv in the dark
popular thing we came up out of your market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates are busily to keep in mind
