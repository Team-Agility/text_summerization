process i'm thinking about that either part you could argue that the remote control
easy to use as a remote control they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
general people change tv more often than batteries on their remote control
remote control we should be easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
speaker the pen and speech recognition and it's cheap or a remote control we want to reduce
simple button and speech recognition technology
back and not to look at a new remote controls it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a i'll put that says creaky what they are actions
people dollars for which the remote control is Is to be something useful that i'm going to talk
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and battery
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology and it's more expensive
location and these people are really interesting on those features or they really like They're more want these fancy features
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology
Generally add developed quite a broad concept of the interface we used and if there is some supplements
flat different colours Depending on what is around like what colours around and depending on the temperature
ready in the post and down to locate then we have to go for some speaker
sixty then you make a lot of money are you don't and you're out of business
plastic we stick with two batteries solar smart
bone shape it has to be more wrong than the More roo look natural
titanium smelling like fruit or do we make spongy on one that animal A chip
chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive they feel is colour lcd
Strangely enough it's more important thing it has to be fancy have to have a fancy look-and-feel and then interestingly
story that for the point before why not the rubber aspect might be important
propose but the use of solar cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy would solar cells hand
record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
friends you can travel from golf to furniture so it might be fruit and vegetable and spongy
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
straight on these individual action g which are for them ram out a bit design
reduce the cost on the display would only be displayed and not a touch sensitive
phone we can use the phone as a good to Example of work to it beeps back
trend i hope i'm going to try to help you want that this is more risky
meeting are on the them first and component concept so what energy and the media and the interface for energy
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
work together a menu on a prototype using modelling clay
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that Mark and then sandy
sammy the product evaluation
puts lots of concentrate
