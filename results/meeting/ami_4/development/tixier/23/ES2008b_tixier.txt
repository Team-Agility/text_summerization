sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control
talk about the technical functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design of the remote control
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
appeals to younger people who have problem with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different at the types of user interface
control so it's one has got lots of buttons could be yellow but we can play
combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
type number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design it's gonna be crucial
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume changing the channel settings
importantly though eighty percent of that they would be willing to buy more for a fee and see you're looking remote
crap remote taking with their tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
economic we need to find out find a way of striking a balance between features and price
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition was inverse be related to age
button on the television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that just received
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television screen just and some text things and they looking graphics
battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip move the data to the receiver
receiver and in my opinion infrared bulb which will then bring
talk about our functions and our target group that means that is very few we need to each group
finally it is more marketing our corporate image has to be recognisable
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d data is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest frustration
backwards up down channel numbers volume freeze frame
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
worry about four minutes i emailed them to you and also putting on them in the shared folder
coffee at the end you just only when really going on or even that those things can go out and you're happy
price limit of the twelve and a half euro to produce
aiming for a technological advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
