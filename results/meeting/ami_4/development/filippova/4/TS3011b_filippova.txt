easy for us to implement to find the remote control button remote control function
luxury a remote control is just a function of remote controls and let them buttons
power buttons and use one time and the volume
round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button
ease of use remote controls the multi function and remote control but many possibilities a great feeling in touching the buttons
channel nineteen you only have that button or change the channel or to not the volume
channel selection you have them to most important or volume selection and the teletext
functions and the money that we can say from that we should use for having a design and thinking about the user interface designer
save costs by not implementing this a function and can be implemented in in our design
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet is replacing teletext
list of Functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all functions available device
important point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control
numbers about the speech recognition here that's younger people do not always want to use the voice
specially designs and energy save design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
base station next a tv set would have such a button because they are lost the remote
opinion the it be easy to catch piece of equipment but it's quite elaborate
cheaper that the chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find the one solution
focus on younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
thumb Determine the costs and things like that battery lifetime energy saving another advantage
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected to free things user interface
hope personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound
decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition has the main it stand
find a balance between the advanced new techniques and the user friendliness
money we say if we using this we can use for an average fancy lights
main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem
bought by people younger parts off the market isn't the forty percent we Want to sell
products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
thirty minutes of time to perform are individual work for ball When it's fun
older you might want to constrain that portion market is to tell million units
dark concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
components which can zoom far less power saving will be a bit more difficult so we can expect
case we have to metal contacts
slight problem I opened the cd rom box accidentally
