cost we should just go for push buttons which is what real reaction
press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
depending them a week at a buttons remain things but then i go back
access the advanced features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
important features for a remote is seen a menu button so that we can access
shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control
buttons to select your favourite channels and the channel flipping and then the other white
channel surfing a scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast
simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip in an lc
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen then back up at your tv and people
case the buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main
watching tv i them wanting to say on the tv and the button to switch
intrigued by the idea of the kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches
advantages and disadvantages if you have an lcd display would have to be quite small
concept of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface list of device
television send information back to the remote control list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end up with the device
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case it can have any titanium
features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv
conceptual design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
ideas had it possibly use these and how to use a fruit and vegetable colours
point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
interface and we'll come back to the chip
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on how should report are produced
switch i was in concept and start something that or show you some examples
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
fickle a or latex cases that it's hard to protect inside but it's covered
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
sending it out's only fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
designer of our real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options that we have for manufacturing
opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford
