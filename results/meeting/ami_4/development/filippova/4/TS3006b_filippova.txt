functions in one button it gets confusing
easier to integrate several functions in one button
screen is all the configuration options you can put that on the screen functions
Channel up and down and the control of the advanced options and functions and buttons is easy
button menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional requirements
reach a little bit for the power button but that's present channel
normal functions and these basic functions you normally press
channel and volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons for a for all the channels
problem with the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen is below and the buttons are in the middle
feel of the left example and then the screen is on top which function
screen on top looks more But logical to me also because people use mobile phone also on top
press said you the screen gets activated and then you can use this buttons to press
design the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
indy it's the remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
channel five on channel settings or channel programming your channels in the right order
remote and that you can choose what the design it's it doesn't make a remote control on noticed in your room
design of the bus buttons but look how you can push them and like that so the physical aspect
week or on the channel number in a remote and which want to save
integrate the screen or speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
larger public we have more options are activated based on some so for options
match the operating behaviour of the users are not afraid of a lot of functions
functions and on the Seems was it the target group so it's above forty
features are hidden in the screen with the clear about the extra two buttons
tv options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble on base
microphone it can be very small phones are just are some stripes a little holes
irrelevant the less use for audio settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour
tvs in standby people don't understand it so so they need a simpler remote
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
confirm a want to go one step back to it to upper level the finally
signal of certain spatial frequencies it's a counters one it shows on your tv
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
lli d and then just was typing it so that all i have to that so switch
communication if the television it's difficult but that's not hard part you don't have to design
wary of space left and then put a logo
save automatically in the project folder the teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
skip this price as because i read a ball forty is it from twenty to forty
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
