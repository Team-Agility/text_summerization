important thing people like to last year was that the remote control should be look fancy
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
small because you have how much nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the lcd screen
printer enough llc d screen if you make screen for called as matter
main you can fit the lcd screen as large as the remote control itself yelling
pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours will be easier to do in colour
meets more the young people can see it because it is the unique
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly people
buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
wood rubber the total piece of rubber is the best suits poll up material
larger it's not really on scale then to work an option for mount station
remote control has no way or in the settings menu to look up some some channels on your television
big difference between young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
options is the settings of the remote enough to tv and that a thing called cults settings
young people they liked fruity colours like reading brown light out dark red yellow
navigate through menu great with the scroll up next to the remote isn't that handy
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
tie That what you'd like to do on the screen is want to go back
men about future of next to each other on a normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
option to use as a in a rather simple chip
easy to have it something like but and minus here the sofa here Minus
shapes it is something between the square shape sit around got on the round corners what's square
chip on print think cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
noticed that be in this file design or the user interface and the buttons
chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
Channel selection for our one of the sixty eight volume we should also be enough for easy
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium
point we already decided that on the previous meeting placed inside our project folder
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
show some points on which we it should take a decision
time we have forty minutes or thirty minutes of forty minutes of use Nx
sense that it you ask you give a question and three seconds later you say the answer
record into the device into the speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
recharge through docking station
agenda the base five presentation is once again or at least an agenda
edit issue to remove degrees
