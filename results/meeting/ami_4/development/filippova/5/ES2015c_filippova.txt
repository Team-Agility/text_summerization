research team of phones and in new multiple all options scroll buttons or just the push button
back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control test
agenda for this so this particular meeting conceptual design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
change the buttons so one same colour it's face could have its own colour of button
actual remote would be hard plastic and put it in rubber plate going on top or would stay
phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons
confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost of buttons functions will show
command interface requires you to type text role commands and input at the keyboard so the numbers
mind more design an hour more user interface to make it more trendy look with user-friendliness
buttons are you don't necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
stick graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point device
wise kinetic thing was stressed about lies it's instant energy saving see all producing the energy
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
numbers of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and you cannot any power
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television that people will be movie remote
difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates in this meeting
end so more internal casing and the rubber coating which is on the case which we pulled aside and rubber
Pop in tarot will have to work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
silly if we do point to have anything else just have to not important
strip it down to like really basic shape
important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be technologically innovative and hope
regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
weapon for the simple the weight that was the advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
due to the fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
lee back inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
method was mainly web-based research this time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
Display anyway you that will probably won't have to focus so much not be more than the numbers
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual components so we'd have to get it in separately
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentations
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty
Screen settings was use zero point five times an hour
dynamo which is the thing that was used to which is fifty years here real remote
stick to tv based maybe tv in the dark
popular thing we came up out of your market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates are busily to keep in mind
