functions in one button it gets confusing
easier to integrate several functions in one button
screen it's more about the functions are are going to to be on the screen menu
Channel up and down and the control of the advanced options and functions and buttons is easy
Menu button menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional requirements
reach a little bit for the power button but that's present channel
normal functions and these basic functions you normally press
ten buttons for a for all the channels you can just push one button and channel and volume
problem with the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen is below and the buttons are in the middle
screen is here then the logo should be like on top which function is that we have left
screen on top looks more But logical to me also because people use mobile phone also on top
press said you the screen gets activated and then you can use this buttons to press
prefer we use the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
research on new features in a remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
channel five and phone account channel anything you want to move the only kind to channel program the channels
remote and that you can choose what the design it's it doesn't make a remote control on noticed in your room
design of the bus buttons but look how you can push them and like that so the physical aspect
channel and then it just say is which number in a remote and which want to save
integrate the screen or speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
extra options are activated based on some so for options that's communicate with the infrared decoder
younger users are not afraid of a lot of functions or make the buttons as user-friendly
functions and on the Seems was it the target that's a group so it's above forty
simple and all that advanced features are hidden in the screen with the clear which buttons
tv options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble on base
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option
irrelevant the less use for audio settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television with that usually three buttons and very hard
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
confirm a want to go one step back to it to upper level which twos and focus
signal of certain spatial frequencies it's a counters one it shows on your tv and so your remote
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
lli d and then just was typing it so that all i have to that so switch
communication if the television it's difficult but that's not hard part you don't have to design
wary of space left and then put a logo
save automatically in the project folder the teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
skip this price as because i read a ball forty is it from twenty to forty
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information that i need so frustrating
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
