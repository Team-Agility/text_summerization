remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control is a device that simple
talk about the technical functions presentation working design how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy going to the user
lots of buttons and that might be older people maybe people specified problem right now is that people's remote
chip through the use of the user interface the user interface concept market trend were watching
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and the relevant the polls buttons hired
combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
weapons you have like you have numbers but you before the next meeting in terms of users
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume changing the channel settings
frozen he can show me to pick up the remote all they want like an upgrade
crap remote taking with their tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
economic we need to find out find a way of striking a balance between features and price
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition was inverse be related to age
button on the television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that just received
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
sends a message to the television screen just and some text things and they looking graphics
battery and that that the chip and convert that much data and presents a while without strips gathering
work or infrared bulb which will then bring
talk about our functions and our target group that means that is very few we need to each group
finally it is more marketing our corporate image has to be recognisable
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest frustration
backwards up down channel numbers volume freeze frame
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting
coffee at the end you just only when really going on or even that those things can go out and you're happy
price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
features and price as you mentioned something called rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
