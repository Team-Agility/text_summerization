cost we should just go for push buttons but i'm it intrigued
press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons
access the advanced features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
important features for a remote is seen a menu button so that we can access
shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control
buttons to select your favourite channels and the volume control could double
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel
simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip
lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
case the buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main
watching tv i them wanting to say on the tv and watch
idea of the kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches
advantages and disadvantages if you have an lcd display would have to be quite small
concept of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface list of device
television send information back to the remote control list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case it can have any titanium
features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv
conceptual design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
covered with the latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
ideas had it possibly use these and how to use a fruit and vegetable colours
point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
interface and we'll come back to the chip
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on how should report are produced
switch i was in concept and start something that or show you some examples
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
fickle a or latex cases that it's hard to protect inside but it's covered
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
fashion and simplicity and easy to use is necessarily the right drinking personally
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
research has been carried out by real reaction company wind focus on fashion
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
