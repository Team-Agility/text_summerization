lawn wanna spend more money on the remote control for double functions
colours are you are many colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour
talk about the components of remote control could just have a properties
case you must use or rubber the buttons to that the rubber
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
idea is that a good idea we have already mentioned all arguments
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station
colour lcd screen and it's very special a very trendy to have a remote control
buttons and it should and the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
elderly people were a little bit crazy in one maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour
possibility i i looked upon was the lcd display fits in that emission

open the conceptual design for a greater resemblance but with new with new colours
pictures of fruit and vegetables And spongy material I found this image
properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material
idea of maybe at that came kind type of body weight and then with plastic colouration rounded
email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility to put a scroll button
functional to indicate which what a device you are controlling test
decided to use only basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
logo our base station is also off the shelf also the speaker
basic idea to use the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights
part of it and then you get a very large lcd screen
resemble what i already said a specific piece of fruit but just like the round curves
tv guide only for the channel with that we were for programs
mute and the teletext and the menu nowadays to access the screen settings
plastic and a soft things and titanium Would also be a bit weird
back began a resolution with it the goal is backs and colours
sell will need to bring out line of tvs which we were planning
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease
spongy thing already comes for in the in the cushions pets and things on this side
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people dark
easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple
save a perhaps a some tiny buttons aren't user-friendly then we wouldn't can implement
easy for you to read the minutes left my know how many colours
transfer and plastic A screen on top of it isn't for mobile
important because it has to be flash a bit and that is a an doesn't have to be in weighing day
tv has to send information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
fruit is a yellow and black and white that's on the old grey
emission know it's like more phone row ball and it adds
