lawn wanna spend more money on the remote control nah
colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour
components of a remote control could just have a properties
case you must use or rubber the buttons to that the rubber
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
idea is that a good idea we have already mentioned all arguments
design of the docking station is something for the bus
colour lcd screen and it's very special a very trendy to have a remote control
buttons and it should and the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
elderly people were a little bit crazy in one maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour
possibility i i looked upon was the lcd display level
thousand and four you can't put something on the market likes
open the conceptual design already resemble some piece of fruit
image which is it's symbolises the idea of fruit and vegetables
material and then you're gonna have like to material lines

email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility to put a scroll button
functional to indicate which what a device you are controlling test
requirements i was thinking about just the basic functions extra big

resemble what i already said a specific piece of fruit rounds
tv guide only for the channel with that we were for programs
time you would have teletext and the menu most tvs
plastic and a soft things and titanium Would also be a bit weird
back began a resolution with it the goal is backs and colours
sell will need to bring their logo and all that back
nineties maybe what we're up to write from to this point
spongy thing already comes for in the in the cushions pets and things on this side
research again about trends for the market for elderly people dark
easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple
save a perhaps a some tiny buttons aren't user-friendly then we wouldn't can implement
part of the minutes are very hard to read text
transfer and plastic A screen on top of it isn't for mobile
important because it has to be flash a bit and that is a an doesn't have to be in weighing day
ia is still don't have any information about the program
fruit is a yellow real young men and then make styles
emission know it's like more phone row ball and it adds
warm use my pen anymore so be it just ordinary keyboard
