parts maybe transparent around the buttons or just the push button
test will have to look at how the remote control
meeting conceptual design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
change the buttons so one same colour it's face it's generated
discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic plate going on top
phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons
confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost of buttons functions will show
command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
complicated and the controls would be more user interface concept
buttons are you don't necessarily a battery but that brings
stick graphical user you must need some presentation for the graphics like an lcd
cutting edge technology wise kinetic energy is a new idea
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
numbers of the channels volume and you cannot any power
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television that people will be movie remote
worked hard for the personal face plates in this meeting
end so more internal casing and the rubber case which we pulled aside and rubber
working this have to shake it a bit and revitalise
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
silly if we do point to have anything else just have to not important
strip it down to like really basic shape
important aspect is that the remote control should be easy
regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
weapon for the simple the weight that was the advanced chip
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg eating
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
keyboard so the numbers are like a keyboard you pressing
method was mainly web-based research this time around i also spoke
Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
powerpoint i can't remember what it's got at the components
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty
Screen settings was use zero point five times an hour
looked at the design reports from previous years here real
stick to tv based maybe tv in the dark
popular thing we came up out of your market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates are busily to keep in mind
