cost we should just go for push buttons
hand and you press the buttons are fun
buttons remain things but then i go back
buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
important features for a remote is seen a menu
shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control
buttons changing the volume favourite channels is applicable
ipods and things right now have touch scroll wheel
simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen
case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
people when i watch tv in the dark
idea of the kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches
lcd display would have to be quite small lcd screen
concept of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface list of device
television send information back to the remote control list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
solar battery although there are slight complications with solar battery
end up with the device going to work
determine what the essential functions of the device
double curved case it can have any titanium
features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv
minutes a new type things you look and feel design
spongy latex it's a spongy is the end
fruit and vegetable or like i don't like a carrot source
find a way to protect like the chip
interface and we'll come back to the chip
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on how should report are produced
number of different choices for a design concept and start
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
fickle a or latex cases that it's hard to protect inside but it's covered
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
research has been carried out by real reaction company wind focus on fashion
simple regular advanced chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
work together on a prototype using modelling clay
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
