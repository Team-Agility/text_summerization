research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote comes in the remote control on the right here is one of the more extravagant
list people are what it about the shape of the remote control
finally the incorporation all far as cd or a speech recognition see stand in the remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech
younger people that gonna wanna buy a very stylish a remote control what's new technology is the people are we gonna have what i was internet connection
personal preference was that we can have a us are sitting there on the remote controls are used by more than one person's And as you targeting single people
focusing on television but still like a universal remote in that as a replacement remote control or is this something for a reminder of televisions
people want to be l to find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote see that see a remote control without numbers they were think it's very difficult to learn ready to go to the different be a baby teeth
mortal which is to be trained and being a micro control to say to turn the volume up because i can't hear very i don't really want you'd run out what people are saying by talking one on one instead of pressing up on the remote control unit
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
channel than a one i what i use a remote control does is it just change that change the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad
wise limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system as a wide and really quite a microphone also to be sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find
talk about price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
meeting about the functional design
channels that you two digit numbers and you have to press a special button is important but also it the number of buttons
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press the press the button to talk and the tvt v set
idea but as a marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition
sitting in between the video input to the tv or we have control of the tv on to the remote controller can bring out menu on but our company's tvs
mobile phones are you don't use you don't remember people's fun be you remember the name and you're fine and then so this would be pretty a pretty wide range of remote controls on ep means talk on which is a customer know written review side
young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
red so if you go to the market and you say that buttons that they're the People it is and on top
priced a remote control it would really be worth us on that would be worth implementing
programme you could have a start time corporate to do with the remote control you start time all the programs
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition gets in the way more than that helps
main formations on the television remote that was universal remotes out on the market no work it does work was supposed to work on and so on the working design issues
buttons it increases the difficulty of find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen you just scroll for that program rubber band to a channel numbers easily
cd screen which helps when you using multiple devices i suppose because you can have multiple functions which have a couple of the round buttons down to a minimum but not quite that interfere with the functionality of the device
relation to know you would be cheaper than the lcd in our remote control
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euro because for twenty five euro we can really do with that but the very basic remote control
programmes on off and you what channel thirty seven because i know this programmes
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big courts and that cords out of stand-by then for a device to the receiver
working design is so user interface could be of two things one is the usual
feed the targets in front of cost it's not possible to goals two lcd
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons for different frequently used costs
focus more on the internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special so you have man
hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be really small
functional requirements and especially for the For the user requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
usual those buttons which there so that the user fee that's that he's smiling doing some he's going aboard the technology switch at existing so deeply the book would be which is the easiest
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
la is that the court is sitting similarly there are different interfaces
people to use on line which a case of by speak buttons out of something which is really everybody's ready in good morning
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
bring testing sings i have seen them on the one that's got a welcome pick it or is this we'll that we can use to navigate
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting you have the task you have to work
master a very easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
scd e still on this get used to open about this cd
forces you had a company which is putting the fashion in electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
selling the potential of the device in use a potentially you can then do a look like change the lights and i close the windows what about the heating
eds they're more like and they good idea is to it looks like a year
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting the green one and it can watch
english it sounds like them and school you know men
imagine also that's the microphone it would be an ambiance and that and then it's microphones
