rabbit double rubber double curved case then we have to you she used rubber push buttons
working with the there's gonna be a rubber or not but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case prevent us from having that cover functional
limited number of buttons are very large and there's only few button so But you have to move
chosen role rubber and if now we have the choice for the case do you want it to facts or curved or single or double curved

squeezing of the rubber be the generating like the energy generator
flat put a blue to use them as a bluetooth remote control is designs to the complete opposite
titanium and for each of them you have the cases where titanium you call use it's foal if you if we choosing a Solar cells then we can choose latex for the case material
Technologically it should be like work to work on the product evaluation
text it's fast and a very much in fruit and vegetables of them are like they have theme for cloths shoes and furniture

discussed earlier on the or at sri problem what we should choose so for the energy
story they're gonna see like three or four normal remote control for the room and try to thirty children
combinations i calculators too combinations of battery with that also using some solar power and we definitely know Tu-dum still be a simple button could be like a big apple
sense have something that's little more technologically advanced and what's on the market
puts even the customer into more control over what the boring instead of you call colours so secure gimmicky bits
run what this fda with them at eight of the material itself so it can be it a plastic or latex or rubber wood or titanium
fancy the kinetic provision of energy
State you'll get lots of people already seen it people
design and by ce two are gonna be working together on this year and we use a coffee machine
Rubber we'll go we'll like that idea you think you can market it as it we're is it stand out you sign or here in your research and they do have they are they would and they complain about our story and this is anti rsi
inside the unit it doesn't affect whether the customers gonna buy this one level you got a remote
remote control market These are like most important aspect it is it's easy

gabriel you're gonna be working on come up with that the user interface topic
find out more money making department sunday like captain was also speaking it's know as advanced but that's a job
telling it's not saying do anything stick it is so maybe you should collect urine offices

part more of a profit sharing on the product
sample that But when you say something or whatever responding
hear about is if we finally decided
voice recognition them and like channel five and a chance like talk
manufacturing division sent some samples of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products like the coffee maker that when you say good morning to it says hello red
irises marketing findings from the last meeting be able to come in and show us so my same physical ideas at the minutes
pushbuttons and sell it can be just simple
