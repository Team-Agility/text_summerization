big banana shaped remote control and casings of different shapes different fruit
switch on the small remote control market so we found that people will people do have preference for a those fancy more one of the remote control should be a technologically
chip more lights everything we just design keyrings fruit shape i quite like the design of that because that could sit
people want like if somebody wanted in banana shaped we will put that case we want to that war waveform
easy to like at the different shape and up in a in this button buttons do we want to just have a device that maybe sets and pretend it's a fruit
gimmick that something economically shape and organic like it to hold based on fruit and vegetables shape so in such a way that any giving can you could be fit
include either with the rid of it some remotes and we give something new technology got are the ones where and as as new design it fancy outlook we really need the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market
engineered so we ended up make it different difficult shape they will just make it mixed and matched type shape realistic banana shape
odd it's just a rainy how you can have different Different buttons don't feel
market survey we have seen that people are we doing to be able to but they want the choir
survey findings was that they want to easy to use a i'm not about the lcd
idea to you then i will these table so she was then people have to like in the cell is out of the time
people have a later date clothes shoes and furniture everything that fruit and veggie day was causing
factor of this vector it is twice as important as the side so the third factor in others are in our market means and take in designing our our remote controls
opposite what does it make the on the upper side you get the fashion on the other side with the microphones so you can place it face time
pictures of some a new remote controls to show you that press escape
user interface where you have cops buttons and you point to it rather than having the output is a stream of text
comfortable to hold easy to hold off on the side you can have a banana look all apple
specifically as voice activated
software for the same recognition setting would actually going for speech thing you said are take now our research and development department came up with some breakthrough
everybody's got a fruit and veg a day was to be process is that what they were data
spongy latex latex as a kinda spongy feel of the material is expected to be spongy the other than just having a plastic look a hard
technologically innovative like glow in the dark think the strip
pointing out that this one the volume it is pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape
necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company colours the lemon wasn't that far I have it doesn't work
idea but for but and for the thing we tried before easy because there will be on lcd c display in the room a different friend i you can just critical whatever the war
meeting in half an hour glass half of what we need not to have a full colour we will just have a half of colour
oval double curved send it to me if we're talking about three or can we can easy
sit on a say in that and It's quite got a quite a steady pace
basis of like reading room of battery will be a good idea but then they have to keep them and they are more whites outside the solar energy
cover the rubber all the plastic casing this email i got from our manufacturing team
today to be they have got they are going crazy with the lcd technology this as a man we small and cheap
pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow he would set the logo and the slogan running up one side
customers should be provided with the mental state is easy to understand in the local language
trend is going to affect a remarkable attention and how important
doubles as a standard parts and for using it as a recharging of also for using it as send recognition
lay that it's got like a little scroll function was come up on the tv screen
scroll it and then when you reach the a menu item that you require you pressed the middle of a scroll wheel and speech recognition
price and price not withstanding is it too complicated it's it can be too much just overloaded
light run x the more features we had the fancy chips we need to buy input and which add to the cost as we can expect
promote any size we like or is there a minimum
discussion over less anybody's got questions The confusions i'm confused
open up there's a circuit board inside it just powers
playing could be green or on and off as reds
secure areas and i've seen a lot of them with the cover missing so like other hand like what it is portable phones whatever have that colour lcd screens
board we have to use bc at the same setup processor are more pro use a more advanced processor than i had and find out that and was into the lower
Mail to use the minutes of the last meeting i'm going to discuss what the trend watching
sends out the infrared light signal to the television writers
harm to the environment also because our company
preference is just a imagination the race symbols everything but it's pointing
twenty five thirty five euros a cat or twelve years fifteen manufacturing
rl the data but it is good for have ten which is quite this for the one that we can begin
automatically if you put in project documents is on the Test
