product miss all the user requirements whether it meets the user requirements or not this product and end
companies a lot of their products in the shape of fruits to give a range of products so they of shaped
buttons would be like individual users
idea but evaluation line in additional do all of our product
rubber to your we are using the scroll buttons like this is the new ideas
design it may be a meeting all the requirements of the customers like it technology wise price
shaped like a way see look at this as think of is to operate a given radio
tool that later that and then That big A button in the middle is the on and off one it's not in the traditional
mind that the specifications are we had to frame vegetables are quite popular and that people like something that is good to look at it and not many buttons
product should be as customers requirement as but let us technology and it should be wiring to save
company strategy so i would go for a one as we know only get to it but we were limited
providing quality products not only incorporating latest technology is but also in terms of writing in my mind turns
technology it's got the latest trends in speech technology
marketing strategy of the company is quite rare bird in the market
designs like we have everyone banana design and the other one is what ends
buy tv maybe the company all have The you can choose from a company on have two or three trace it is but the different designs
Basic requirements part of the pro of the project
counts as a curve over that's just a shape
product me steve to face or terms of the market
user requirement is essentially just to operate a tv
project evaluation we have on the crap out here is fifty Project
people don't want any complicated or bulky project and i will say is quite simple and quite handy
scroll once we still could be channel up and down and volume
produce minus the extra scroll buttons and it's gonna cost is for doing point six euros
parts and then like a banana out all and you are limiting
fair share data shows that people like everything else everything that is being advertised like those shows and everything is being able to it in the form of fruit and veggie they were all getting them some as it is or showing some association
company name on the front which is a little black a line in the middle
hold on to find a shift button
speak into that like little ball that we that to add a day
entering the evaluation criteria meeting with seven point scale
hand because we already stated that people do graph of fashionable things nowadays
click back and that bottom right so we're starting from when you see arrow keys
important factor for evaluation notes of that marketing
trendy to some i'm just not small and the fruit good to look at the like school
views on the basis of design was she was a very interface expert radio
traditional remote control conforms to the company strategy is that the question
end times leds as but if a latest fashion trend
buy wouldn't have to be curved would be if it was that someone curve in this one is single curve on both sides
order to say even are two euros i was thinking That we could have a sense of the same shape but just have a flat
electronics it's not always quite say you don't always have so many choices is with talk to you that no fire agreement
curvature rest like there is case giving only one or two traces we are leaving limiting them the olympic i would say the same thing over profit
ideas like glow in the dark like that we discussed
keeping it keeping in mind all the safety issues
holiday pay maybe in order
bigger so we might be more space other than no one space and that's marked
simple that's the charging base prongs of the boss
yellow orange and it powered
eat any proper goes a week or they use these are just rubber
standard word standard
main problem that we have one for sleep being the finance
chair or get you're getting a risk that teamwork
induce more television watching this poster
raised out and then i feel free
stories the powerpoint i I was that was a phone
wall or forgotten familiar the minutes
