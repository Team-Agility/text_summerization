hundred a new remote control is quite subjective experience
sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control
talk about the technical functions design objectives
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote control
chip which is also controlled by the user
parts of the working design presentation i have a pet
device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
remember that remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control hear she expects the buttons to be in certain places
appeal to people specified problem with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons that they have offered to them on the remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people losing it too if it's the it's a fun
chip through the use of the user interface the user interface concept market trend were watching
mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled That extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working designers figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
bothered to pick up the remote all they want like an upgrade
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people don't wanna be changing
control so it's one has got lots of buttons with essentials
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy into data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us transmitting the data to the receiver
importantly though eighty percent of that they would be willing to pay more for a fee and see you're looking remote and that ties
people are so is that like change the channel and changing the volume freeze frame
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design it's gonna be crucial
type in the page number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicate like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
breaks i was given in terms of each was the voice recognition was inverse be related to age
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or adjust
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
shared a quite a bit rate anyone wants to work on each task a step
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
talk about our functions and our target group that means that is very few we need to each group
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d data is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest frustration
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
receiver and in my opinion infrared
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel settings
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
putting on them in the shared folder
prominent as the main features and price as you mentioned something called rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
instruction manual it comes at the end of the spectrum
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
worry about four minutes i emailed them to you and also putting
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
price limit of the twelve and a half euro without having to make too many of a compromise
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
Switch the quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
charging station like a mobile phone Or like a little cradle for your ipod
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
