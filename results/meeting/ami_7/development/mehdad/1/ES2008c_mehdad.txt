lots of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
cost we should just go for push buttons would recharge the battery
hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional button to switch off in case you get bored
onscreen menu of your channel traces then you can scroll down on the scrolling
main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as or the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
people to be able to use it as a remote control get a certain amount of a light
thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel
tend to watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv and watch
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
decided on like a simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip depending
sit there and stand control the television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
intrigued by the idea of the scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery although there are slight complications with solar battery
money into the like the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
concept of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface and we'll come back to the chip
case out of plastic them the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
member of that this is the device this is an ipod from apple
curve gonna make one curve of a case we could do a flat which flat case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved case or it maybe even a double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
screen there are on the actual tv i them wanting to say on the tv
buttons could be shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours maybe free vegetable colours
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts panel close
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
examine each element separately but we're designing
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
find a way to protect the circuit board
double curved like would that be like two hands time i am imagining
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
related to this but of latex cases that it's hard to cover with the latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
minutes a new type things you look and feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
minute or if you the minutes left of the meeting
stressing more talking we then talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
small tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look and feel and as these are range the top one is double important
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
reverse it but if we're working this company that i there are what we have to stress fashion watchers in paris and milan comments on some things that are gonna be go on this year
list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
research has been carried out by real reaction company wind focus on fashion
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options that we have for manufacturing
envisioning more like the material like you have when you said megabytes of also it doesn't hurt
saved it this in the shared project
