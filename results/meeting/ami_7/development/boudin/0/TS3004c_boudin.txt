morning remote control and remote controls
document be sent to the station of the remote control and the recharger
curved remote controls we must use rubber buttons
basic buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons
top buttons we don't use some in the bottom
back lights look will look very new one know rubber buttons
smaller remote control you can cd or you have to but you reach both both sides
current controllers are all black and plastic then the buttons
volume channel to choose channels and on off used to the button and that takes a few buttons other functions
difference if you put this this switch channels on side of it on top
numbers should be in the bottom and the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons
volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake
modern remote controls the buttons are part so focuses on these two parts
green colour the backlight
back that you'll get the button you knew a lot more like the that meant that and they three player
important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel instead of the current functional look-and-feel so it's very important
important aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative big door
shape should be curved So round shapes not nothing square
difference is that we use a scroll wheel
basic care colour fronts
drop it you wanna change the volume and top down is more with the channel changing
blinking light on my phone and change the colour
light blue and transparent
spec to the remote control should be easy to know me for a push to the yup
chip so if we use speech recognition
sense if you put it somewhere in the chances the beautiful scroll wheel
yellow on the side and black on the front
recognition We i don't think we should put it on top band that if we gonna put in more technology eugene need to be able to switch to open
man a young public you should use materials or soft with primary colours like green blue red so Flashy kinda colours the shape
chip can be a simple a regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced
normal infrared led it's sufficient
display requires an advanced chip so the regular chip
divide you have to round it on the button and of skip
ipod And and three players mobile phones
room no just battery context like normal batteries just a rechargeable batteries expense
personal thing is that we should go more modern look and d player
slide in the docking station
country use different for fronts that's always know the logo
receive information about the cost but just a about the chip
show you the And i the the menu to that what's it called scroll-wheel make it in yellow just like the colours of real reaction
sense for an original look and feel of the case and interface
date display in the ipod a compared to the basic or you can choose one if you buy the project
kinetic a like but the polls watch so it operates
design so i did some searching on the internet
case transparent on the wise
usability is very important people that want to spend money on something that's similar devices and my own common knowledge
target group we talk about was young public
features and then that this is a point of discussion
tad next aspect also in contrast to last year the feel of material suspect it is expected to the role on this one at this moment
telephone also have a lcd and that's about two hundred euros
developed a new speech recognition feature integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit is a very small electronic units will give a standard answer of should recognise the question
mother into like this area up so the focus
uid work together on a prototype drawing a smartboard
ergonomic fits in hand
sports and gaming to vines style two or three sticks
