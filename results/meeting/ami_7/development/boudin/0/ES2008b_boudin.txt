remote control is quite subjective experience
sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls
talk about the technical functions design objectives
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls in the analysing
chip which is also controlled by the user
parts of the working design presentation i have a pet
device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
remember that remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control hear she expects the buttons to be in certain places
lots of buttons and that might be older people maybe people specified problem right now is that people's remote
designing the user interface is critical
mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled That extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design presentation and the functional requirements
money to buy a new remote
combination of electrical energy source people don't wanna be changing
control so it's one has got lots of buttons with essentials
components that we find here are the energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
importantly though eighty percent of that they would be willing to pay more for a fee and see you're looking remote and that ties
people are so is that like change channel change the volume people
chip that he in this designing it's gonna be crucial
type numbers but you before the next meeting in terms of users
older people didn't really care for voice recognition
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
desire for voice recognition was inverse be related to age
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
control in this index opinions on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or focused
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
investment should use novel idea of an lcd screen was brought
easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task a step
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find specific target group
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest frustration
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
receiver and in my opinion infrared
audio setting is then given it much important and visibility on the remote as a minute channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel settings
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
thirty minutes of individual work
features and price as you mentioned something called rsi
examples probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion in electronics
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros to produce
short amount of time you get specific in crap instructions from your personal coach emailed
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range of ages
companies like apple have you might lot of progress
charging station like a mobile phone Or like a little cradle for your ipod
ready tidy right Let's see lucy
