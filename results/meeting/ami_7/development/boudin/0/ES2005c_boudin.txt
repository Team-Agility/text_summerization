big banana shaped remote control and casings of different shapes different fruit
cheap remote controls is graphical interface
chip more lights everything we just design keyrings fruit shape
people want like if somebody wanted in banana shaped we will put that case we want to that war waveform
easy to like at the different shapes of the buttons in translates into the sequence of courses that it then sends the amplifier
fruit shape so in such a way that any giving can you could be fit
include either with the rid of it some remotes and we give something new technology got are the ones where and as as new design it fancy outlook we really need the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market
banana shape they will just make it mixed and matched type shape
odd it's just a rainy how you can have different Different buttons don't feel
market survey we have seen that people are we doing to be able to but they want the choir
people find that important aspect in the data to take into consideration is that it should be easy
idea because people use mile mice mouse is now with the scrolling
people have a later date clothes shoes and furniture everything that fruit and veggie day was causing
factor of this vector is the most important factor
buttons option on one side you get the fashion on the other side with the microphones so you can place it face time
pictures of some a new remote controls to show you that press
interface the buttons and you point to it rather than having the output is a stream of text
slide you are holding off on the side you can have a banana look all apple
specifically as voice activated
setting would actually going for speech thing you said are take now our research and development department saying that they have broken three would certainly speech recognition software that you can programme
lady that fruit and veg a day was to be process is that what they were data
play-doh latex as a kinda spongy feel of the material is expected to be spongy the other than just having a plastic look a hard
glow in the dark think the strip
pointing out that this one the volume it is pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape
necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company colours the lemon wasn't that far I have it doesn't work
idea but for but and for the thing we tried before easy because there will be on lcd c display in the room a different friend i you can just critical whatever the war
wider for a banana design caving in such a way like half of what we need not to have a full colour we will just have a half of colour
double curved send it to me if we're talking about three or can we can easy
method we did the existing designs
rechargeable battery will be a good idea but then they have to keep them and they are more whites outside the solar energy

today to be they have got they are going crazy with the lcd technology notes
easily have the main body blue with the yellow logo and Slogan running up one side
customers should be provided with the mental state is easy to understand in the local language

doubles as a standard parts and for using it as a recharging of also for using it as send recognition
lay that it's got like a little scroll function on the side but i presume that the functions was come up on the tv makers
scroll it and then when you reach the a menu item that you require you pressed the middle of a scroll wheel and speech recognition
price and price not withstanding is it too complicated it's it can be too much just overloaded
light run x the more features we had the fancy chips we need to buy input and which adds
work on giving me a model in clay
discussion over less anybody's got questions The confusions i'm confused
open up there's a circuit board inside it just powers
specific functions all that in a play stop it got a minute
