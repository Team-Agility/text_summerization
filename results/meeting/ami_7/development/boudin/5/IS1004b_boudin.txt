ready Betty often because they lost the remote control so it could be so if you cindy minutes
list people are what it about the shape of the remote control
finally the incorporation all far as cd or a speech recognition see stand in the remote control Being one or beyond thing and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech
people that gonna wanna buy a very stylish a remote control what's new technology is the people are we gonna have what i was internet connection
personal preference was that we can have a us are sitting there on the remote controls are used by more than one person's And as you targeting single people
focusing on tv but still like a universal remote in that as a replacement remote control or is this something for a reminder of televisions
people as see a remote control without numbers they were think it's very difficult to learn ready to go to the different be a baby teeth
remote control to say to turn the volume up because i can't hear very i don't really want you'd run out what people are saying by talking one on one instead of pressing up on the remote control unit
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
channel than a one i what i use a remote control does is it just change that change the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad
automatic speech recognition system as a wide and really quite a microphone also to be sitting on the remote
point because actually having all that some of the remotes out there this is quite although our price
meeting about the functional design
option is to have that will fit but then door that that you have hidden mice the time that contains the extra buttons like say the number buttons
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press a button to talk and the tvt v set
users as our marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition
contacts with people and tv or we have control of the tv on to the remote controller can bring out menus on but our company's tvs
mobile phones are you don't use you don't remember people's fun be you remember the name and you're fine and then so this would be pretty a pretty wide range of remote controls on ep means talk on which is a customer know written review side
bring new technologies for young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
People so complain because they all have the same size of the voters four buttons which are not betty
priced a remote control it would really be worth us on that would be worth implementing
restrict the remote control to tv only because of time to start time all the programs
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition to adjust and that can fit
main formations on the tv that we can work was supposed to work on and so on the working on television remote that was universal is that they have a lcd screens
point to To find it with missus and they improvements we could do to the car and remote controls
possibility is to download programme information into the lcd screen you just scroll for that program rubber band to a channel
screens which helps when you using multiple devices i suppose because you can have multiple functions which have a couple of the round buttons down to a minimum but not quite that interfere with the functionality
cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important
twenty five euro because for twenty five euro we can really do with that but the very basic remote control for twenty five euros eddie hattie
programmes on off and you what channels already what's on If you have a list
televisions that really makes a big courts and that cords out of stand-by then for a device to the receiver
working design is so user interface could be of two things one is the usual
feeling is that it's Rick regarding costs digits we have and target price it's not possible to goals two lcd
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons for different frequently used costs
extra internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special so you have man
hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should feed the hand shape
lcd you need more requirements like a big courting all those things are required and for wise
usual those buttons which there so that the user fee that's that he's smiling doing some he's going aboard the technology switch at existing so deeply the book would be which is the easiest
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
la is that the court is sitting similarly there are different interfaces
speak buttons out of something which is really everybody's ready in good morning
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
bring testing sings i have seen them on the one that's got a welcome pick it or is this we'll that we can use to navigate
blind about what i what the prepared for this meeting we do that we take some decisions that they record sex
master a very easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
scd e still on this get used to open about this cd
optional extra did gonna make our product since we say we put in the fashion in electronics
task say you have like a little not a little gonna base unit they can also receive signals of wills the television where you can say change the lighting in the room
names that we could decide fall just to get something fun for our project we should we could discuss quickly Any ideas
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting the green one and it can watch
english it sounds like them and school you know men
imagine also that's the microphone it would be an ambiance and that and then it's microphones
final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
