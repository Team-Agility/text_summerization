watchers but remote control for double functions maybe buttons like that and to control that's lcd
colour lcd screen and it's very special to our remote controls are already on the market is simple
email with a with an remote control and you want to retrieve it and the base
fruits and vegetables it has to be colourful
colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour look like it the plastic mold is in one colour and thus those cushion pets around it are in another colour set
important thing is a fancy look-and-feel of remote control
talk about the materials it's a good idea to use plastic in tears would softer rubber
telling me that when we build a remote control of of plastic or rubber the buttons to that the rubber double curved case is is it a three dimensional curve in the design
materials and components of remote control could just have a properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material like a hard plastic
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
idea the fruit rounds
control if that's a good idea of maybe is a little bit Too much for twelve and a half Abduction
banana is it's it's not easy for remote control
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station at the bottom
design already resemble what i already said a specific piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity
technical part and the material and then you're gonna have like to material lines
basic buttons to skip channels
number so we have the power button skip the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
mode after the trailers of lcd display i don't want to in a three the house
idea of maybe at that came kind type of body weight and then with plastic colouration rounded
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people dark colours simple recognisable shapes
transfer and plastic is the best with rubber of wood or titanium Would also be a bit weird
image which is it's symbolises the idea of fruit and vegetables in christ stick with the remote control
thousand and four you can't put something on the market which is on the ground
top and when you have a table for more than two weeks she just gets annoying because it still be too flashy
buttons has to be solid two and the material is soft rubber
forgot the email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility to put a scroll button
functional to indicate which what a device you are controlling test
puts an extra x and on the simplicity of our remotes to make these two most basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
sell and then tie a title for programme or at least at a quite large part of the rc The up and the upper part or whatever it's it's not use wood buttons
design experts we will work that half
time you would have teletext and the menu nowadays to access the screen settings
spongy thing already comes for in the in the cushions pets and things on this side
Drawl really nicely of the best we can put the logo and all that back
easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple electronic all chip is available with the led transmission or a transmitter
war after to give it to do the soft rubber for falling and it feels
tv guide only for the channel with that we were for programs
part of the minutes are very hard to read because there are two documents that one layer
back to the costs again but we get a bill but pretty cheap design to see if they within our limits of twenty five euros
reaches a different marked but it doesn't cost really much effort to bring teletext to the tid the result
chip the chipset and the board it'll off the shelf also the speaker and wireless retriever are all available in our company
colour lcd which is really pretty trendy but i don't think it will be too expensive
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease
fruity thing is just the shape should be for today this is fruit just round curves
basic idea you got we're probably gonna have like to type of materials like the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights we have to incorporate slides
colours is very important because it has to be flash a bit and that is a an doesn't have to be in weighing day when you're gonna something's
ia is still don't have any information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
base things we'll read discuss the know fees
combine it or with it yellow and black and white that's on the old grey
big team of artists
Sports and gaming what you find a balance
switch from softer works it's also too much to the lawn wanna spend
