buttons are you don't necessarily need to have it on remote
parts maybe transparent around the buttons or just the push buttons
back so i had so many buttons on and the shape was so some that's that are be pressing like a volume but instead of that one button
cost of buttons what functions will show
research into the different components that we could use what's available to us to actually make the remote control them all these patterns
depending on what kinds of the design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
actual remote would be hard plastic and put it in rubber can get on top
phone that has like a rubber casing is that would be were rubber encapsulate in all of these Chips and diodes and delicate technology
research team of phones and in new multiple all options scroll buttons that actually that control controls that are behind the rubber
remote control would be cheaper design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface
agenda for this so this particular meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design
command interface requires you to type text role commands that the user uses to control its operation and input at the keyboard so the numbers
stick graphical user you must need some presentation for the graphics like an lcd
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates are busily to keep in mind
buttons so one same colour it's face could have its own colour of button
learn from mistakes of all are interface that can be too complicated for people
Pop in tarot will have to work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job
include good like ten to earlier there are these different options maybe for the television that people will be movie remote
numbers of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power would be some symbol
mind more design an hour more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons
cutting edge technology wise kinetic energy source idea that's been used by some watches and that devices where you just shake in the device and it gives it to power to make a circuit
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
source that are that's quite an advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house cat our dog
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be technologically innovative and hope
Screen settings was use zero point five elements on a scale of ten that's brightness
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
selling point that is just the basic shape
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
rubber that's used and stress balls and things that says rei not so stressful
regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
main internal feature it is a circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
titanium is not to be possible in know it just to be on top budget
decision is chip which will probably decide whether we buy a simple regular advanced
source is not necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
recent fashion update to have a quite a fashion watchers in paris and milan is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
method was mainly web-based research this time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual components so we'd have to get it in separately
Display anyway you that will probably won't have to focus so much not be more than the numbers
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint in a trying call
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user
lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat then i got like on a cell phone a mobile phone so called a flat
keyboard so the numbers are like a keyboard you pressing
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting the interior lighting system
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
looked at the design reports from previous years here real swimming or a store
power which we've been sitting inside a building
popular thing we came up out of your market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
audio settings mono stereo pitch
personal coach will be the best of the information We need to start making some more specific decisions
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost report
