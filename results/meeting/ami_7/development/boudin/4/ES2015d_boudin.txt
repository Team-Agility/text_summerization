sense for the middle what's been just an enter button so then you would have to press two buttons it's all pushbuttons
number like sixty five to channel sixty five to press the six it'll go to channel two instead of twelve thirty
question number two that's Is it tech and technologically innovative
task so we could've done it a bit more time do we somehow incorporate
wear to work out the a number the plus system
accessible buttons are the volume and the channel changing
simplistic so people be willing to spend twenty five euros we have to market
stress ball was like in taking your hand off the remote

sample design we want is all to be Accessible from your cell am house
conceptual and functional Would we were very creative
natural movement and just going like that with your thumb The economics and to just a single how hand-held device you don't need to use both hands one hand and use your index finger
si which was repeated strain injury
inspired from i if you get instant a mango week
