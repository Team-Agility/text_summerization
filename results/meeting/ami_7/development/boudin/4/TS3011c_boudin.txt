scroll wheels because it's all curved
personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control
remote control and talking to it but it still need to points to the television
double curved then you can that's you can only use the rubber buttons you can as you scroll wheels
scroll scroll wheels that's the speaker the speech recognition the rubber The fancy colours
grip a places in the remote control you have your hand on one place on a remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb So in that case
problem when you're watching a movie how many times you take the remote control in the in an amount of time Any wanted to switch the channel
casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved or flat case that's the most common remote can control form
images on the rubber of the case you must use used by should have pushbuttons
case of the volume button and either on the side or the side but do you touch
scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button integrating the scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons
interface we can have a high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
energy we decided chip
colours is to back and white forearm i had a market group
cd displays there's no way you can integrated scroll bar on this side
simple regular chips we can still control advanced functions the chip for the sample
scroll wheel yes the voice recognition you can program like thirty Where'd you can controls
work with double curved single curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
customers specifically ask for the spongy feel and that's what you get with rubber
discussion the digits six on the bus and it will disappear when it's from rubber
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
finishing this is what's on the edge what you feel your remote control you just rub on the cover so you're up on the painting
runs on the buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch
fruit and vegetables are important findings are innovation is more important than Ease of use for the our target group
previews i deserve voice recognition and the round buttons for the channel programming and volume up Of newt that's a mute
yellow case and grey buttons
suggest we use the sensor sample the sample sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip i fault
material but we're since we're cost reading room The younger group likes a more colourful
company colour something like a red of black and yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours
forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic cover with the rubber finishing
latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cells as energy source which brings
kinetic thing it is it's possibility is more sense of it and you can store
imagine it's very goal to talk to a device with you have two points buttons in a form
problem here is that it's supplies at the very little amount of kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it's against the wall
talk about all the different components wire in this design and it's too dull
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar panel and hand dynamo
lcs ids at this is what this is my personal preference but i bet i understood that the market likes new fresh technology and lc
space in our finance i would say do integrated
difference between a sense than direct the versions of the advanced version which is a bill
program it you musically you give and And action to it's that's really the mute
devices like at telephones and are radio pocket radios
watch in a display or which channel you have chosen like that often the amount of volume
watch you watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of energy then the shaking of your body which is all was every actively make body shake it charges
indicators we have the lcd displays
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
fashion watchers found out that the young target group like fruit and vegetables In their clothes shoes and furniture
forty minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
cable go back to that slide
carpets on the wall which are natural of mean friends
talk with our manufacturing department is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion
email is immediately start with the individual presentations the programmes
