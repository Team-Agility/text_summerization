fruit bat that in that aspect of a of the remote control to be the shape of a banana
base decision and there is a button there are that are more to start beeping so with the remote control that looks like a banana which few buttons
bring to the remote control because of costs
user's gonna buy a banana remote
buying an eel control the remote you do need my income for a remote buying
findings is uses would be really interested in a look at the doing to find that the shape of a fruit which is handy
remote is going to have what they interfaces scroll as as button but push technology for channel selection volume control and they need exposing these are the three scroll buttons on the banana
face to put their cd on the banana if you could have the colour of a banana
easier to do a banana and plastic
starting is good but you could you should have more the shape of banana you wanna of holders may you may be one of the whole like a gun know and you don't have to point toward the fall
base station even if it's just you press that button on that and and the remote control starts beeping this is a way of finding the remote
unaware at this point of the fruit for kids
control a thing which a user should it should be already p define
buttons are in the fit of shape of fruits upload banana
cost a lot just feel five watch
powerful are powered by a man though it's a button on the fruit design the number eight maybe we wanna so what collection of fruit but a different fruit for each device
morning coffee machine me to recognise that for it and it'll play back good morning how would you like a coffee
people would find out what's it even if it wasn't a recharging station even if they didn't have to buy batteries that rechargeable batteries so all the period of car find him to cut the cost
telephone handset is there and the base station is nothing more just it's that by which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket
unique problem with television's is that if you have this got this scroll-wheel for the television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll
worth but it doesn't really add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech recognition technology just because of some reasons and all honesty
wall or a sporting keywords but everybody's and saying it's volume and channel we also want one for the volume is it's it's very handy for it to have the instant feedback and response
received an email i'll and lunchtime they know that the bring in mind to the technology division has developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit
top of that we can have solar cells
meeting we should take a decision on that point it has to a circuit board
mice for some people more functional and then carmine but if they have these scroll-wheels
regular chip all control rising is a factor
genetically engineered for it is designed to be square so they'd attack start it in the boxes
card application i would presume that it's they wouldn't design of the hand and you had a lot of so phase two The for the controls
basis a extra for the functionality is such as the wheels the speaker you need so that in on the list but the device which can do all many things idea why a switch these days and to watch
beep or people are more the devastating never find a fancy look-and-feel instead of a instead of the car and The car and train which was for the functional look and feel down in the technology gonna be know in innovation
advanced technology lcd has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out so it's the basic

spend but charge idea of a banana but without looking completely pointless For the in the fall from the interaction
house so we don't have much problems so component costs
additional it will be might be having slightly better market
break so you'd have to worry too much about the case the chip then if it's too far away from a the casing was the casing is too thick then you may not hear the the speaker
real recognise i he was but he was in a set not like a freight you train it for a certain for a certain phrase
cells and the lighting conditions are good that can be useful it'd be pretty in a week
clarify this these questions that they had in the meeting a few minutes of the last meetings
move on right so studies running with the prototype is but actually integrated
default be forced the findings a meeting i like to draw some sketch about so which would be the pro the final product and that were strip
shape if you'd and not be out the door probably you may as do it in a style as way that just looks a bit more twenty first century route and sixties and seventies
story speak if presentations just to draw some sketch
plastic you can have the book but the side not the materials like wood that's got a grinding you put some of an agenda
set it that's a switch with the double curve would actually menu
feature a rough loads for the tools
microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big deal
fascinates It's freed and they this thing is free time
ctv you need internet connection
