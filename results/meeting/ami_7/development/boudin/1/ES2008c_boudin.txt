keeping a very small and simple set of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
simple movements like pushing buttons which is what real reaction
user remotes you press the buttons are fun
matter how many buttons remain things but then i go back
onscreen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as or the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control
important features for a remote is seen a menu system a bit like on the ipod
people they blinked on the important aspects of a remote control get a certain amount of a light
ipods and things right now have touch scroll buttons
buttons changing the volume favourite channels is applicable
people when i watch tv in the dark
access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip depending
point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
people think about this kinetic that you don't have to replace
ri uses for buttons to me to move around so range of settings so on a small lcd screen then back up at your tv and people
information i have no idea of the scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
solar battery although there are slight complications with solar battery
money into the like the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
concept of the user interface we have to decide on whether i have a scroll
bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main this'll be plastic
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
model is a going to be for user interaction with this device this is an ipod from apple
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
screen there are on the actual tv if you're changing the brightness tuning the tv
changeable covers like for your mobile in different fruit and vegetable colours we could colour
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
start something that or show you some examples
examine each element separately but we're designing
spongy latex it's a spongy is the end
international be on we said but for all age groups different functions to keep the remote from getting lost a large buttons for the essential functions a possibility for extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries
end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
find a way to protect like the chip
double curved like would that be like two hands time
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
hit my understanding of old latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
minutes a new type things you look and feel design meeting and it's sending
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
stressing more talking we then talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
presentation i have one more slide before we close but in that side we thought of it a little text
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
work together on a prototype using modelling clay
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
objectives were simplicity and fashion in technological elements we can add in the word latex titanium or rubber or other coloured types of plastic
list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
designer of our real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
simple regular advanced chip-on-print as that machine prince on the wires and source
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
mind that these are the options that we have for manufacturing
envisioning more like the material like you have when you said megabytes of also it doesn't hurt
saved it this in the shared project
