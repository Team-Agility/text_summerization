easy to find your remote control button remote control function
dec design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
unique feature of a remote control is just a function of remote controls so we might want to build in the future to support them Some audio signal like one phones
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons and use one time and the volume and the programme one and some fancy lights
multi function and remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user
functions and the money that we can say from that we should use for having a design and thinking about the user interface designer
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected
function and the problem to programme button or change the channel switching
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to change the channel
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set would have such a button because they are lost the remote controls
channel selection is the most important or volume selection and the teletext
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs by not implementing a lot of functions
important thing for people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control reports
multi function the technical design or energy save design we should really implement
important button And there are lots of people do not use all the extra features
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip set a circuit boards
opinion the it be easy ease of equipment but it's quite elaborate
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
numbers about the speech recognition here that's younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
restriction the characteristics of clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound from other sounds which aren't exactly the same from the point if you all from remote control
user interface connect to chip which is connected
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost circuit board
list of Functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all functions available device
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition has the main it stand
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment
hebrew i bet devices which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution
chip which just a voice recognition our circuit board will become even more cheap
big advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
buy personally we should infer use infrared
production cost rr in just a part of the equipment
move the stick to to a position maybe light
find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness and it can be more trendy in and use design
device in a light roll it charges
money we say if we using this we can use for an average fancy lighting and techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
important point is that we really should use energy friendly components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger parts off the market isn't the forty percent we Want to sell
thirty minutes of time to perform are individual work for ball When it's fun
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product on the target group and the functions of the remote control
marketing expert will receive you will do some trendwatching
watching a movie it would can see beep
home station for base station next a tv is a bus with nancy
dark concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
disadvantages that there are so concerns about the costs and things like that battery lifetime energy saving another advantage
seconds i received some new project documents folder
slight problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
