idea because you if you and you drop your remote control and remote controls of a moment
document be sent to the station of the remote control in a recharger
hold it you can't all the control and push the buttons like text easy to put that on the button
compared to the basic buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons
pretty standard these rubber buttons are wish there should be on top
back lights look will look very new one know rubber button
smaller remote control you can cd or you have to but you reach both both sides
Basic remote control are all black and plastic it's that our problem
volume and channel to choose channels and on off used to the button and that takes a few buttons other functions
difference if you put this this switch channels on side of it on top
numbers should be in the bottom and the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel in the middle
putting the volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake
modern remote controls the buttons are part of the just it's part of the remote control
green colour the backlight
back that you'll get the button you knew a lot more like the that meant that and they three player
find that the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy and it looks original
important aspect and we must use some of the new technology to be innovative big door
shape should be curved So round shapes not nothing square
difference is that we use a scroll wheel will still the plo
basic care colour fronts
drop it you wanna change the volume and top down is more with the channel changing
blinking light on my phone and change the colour
fancy because of the lights on the bottom that's what difference
spec to the remote control should be easy to know me for a push to the yup
decided that we don't to make use of a lcd or speech recognition you need some way many more buttons
sense if you put it somewhere in the chances the beautiful scroll wheel
deciding yellow and it did the top and black and yellow the world
top band that if we gonna put in more technology eugene need to be able to switch to open
man a young public you should use materials or soft with primary colours blue red and green
chip can be a simple a regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced
normal infrared led it's sufficient
expensive most expensive chip We need if we doing if we're doing a display
divide you have to round it on the button and of skip
original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod And and three players mobile phones
energy source we can use batteries just a rechargeable battery that's cheaper
personal thing is that we should go more modern look and d player
slide in the docking station
low if we will a lot of room to put in as logo
strange that i receive any information about the cost but just a about the chip
show you the And i the the menu to that what's it called scroll-wheel make it in yellow just like the colours of real reaction
sense for an original look and feel of the case and interface
date display in the ipod a compared to the basic or you can choose one if you buy the project
kinetic a like but the polls watch so it operates
design so i did some searching on the internet
case transparent on the wise
usability is very important people that want to spend money on something that's similar to a cheaper
target group we talk about was young and trendy
stands for a new technical features and then that this is a point of discussion
tad next aspect also in contrast to last year the feel of material suspect it is expected to be spongy
telephone also have a lcd and that's about two hundred euros
record followed by a question sample and offer a few seconds else or a sample speaker unit
mother into like this area up so the focus
uid work together on a prototype drawing a smartboard
