scroll wheels because it's all curved
personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control
remote control and talking to it but it still need to points to the television
flawless Think about a scenario where you would use the scroll buttons you can as you scroll wheels
possibility for us to use scroll bar the scroll wheels i also have some information
hold a remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb So in that case
watching a movie and you haven't move the remote a remote control in the in an amount of time Any wanted to switch the channel
casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved or flat case that's the most common remote can control form
note if you want to use these rubber of the case you must use used by should have pushbuttons
volume button and either on the side or the side but do you touch
scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons
extra high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
energy we decided chip
colours is to back and white forearm i had a market group
cd displays there's no way you can integrated scroll bar on this side
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular
scroll wheel yes the voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
work with double curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
customers specifically ask for the spongy feel of the material has to be spongy
discussion the digits six on the bus and it will disappear when it's from rubber
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
finishing this is what's on the edge what you feel your remote control you just rub on the cover so you're up on the painting
runs on the buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch
fruit and vegetables are important but innovation is more important than Ease of use for the our target group
previews i deserve voice recognition and the round buttons for the channel programming and volume
light blue and it's also a yellow
suggest we use the sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip
cost rating on the young group a step further dark colours simple shapes from the material
company colour something like a red of black and yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours
forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic cover with the rubber finishing
latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cell solution for the energy
kinetic thing it is it's possibility is more sense of it and you can store
issue i addressed at the Point i would like to some issues that would like to point
mine doesn't have kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it's against the wall
phase source and is the design of the look and feel The user interface design
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar panel and hand dynamo
lcs ids at this is what this is my personal preference but i bet i understood that the market
space in our finance i would say do integrate some functions
version of the advanced a version of the chip supports lcd that's all and we've decided
piece of this action with which you believe it is you use a mute
devices like at telephones and are radio pocket radios
watch in a display or which channel you have chosen like that often the amount of volume
watch you watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of energy then the shaking
indicators we have the lcd displays
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
fashion watchers found out that the young target group like fruit and vegetables In their clothes shoes and furniture
back in thirty minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
cable go back to that slide
carpets on the wall which are natural of mean friends
talk with our manufacturing division is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion
email is immediately start with the individual presentations the programmes
