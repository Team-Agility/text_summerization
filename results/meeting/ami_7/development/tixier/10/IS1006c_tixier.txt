process i'm thinking about that either part you could argue that the remote control
easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone
device on that can be used for speech recognition and it's cheap or a remote control we want to reduce
people dollars for which the remote control is Is to be something useful that i'm going to talk
simple button and speech recognition technology
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
market of remote controls they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention
heard that it seems that speech recognition or a beer cans with speech recognition
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a i'll put that says creaky what they are actions
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
back and not to look at a new remote controls it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole
expensive since we want to port some other features that speech recognition you want the radios
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and battery
colours of like fruits and vegetables and spongy
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology inside
chip do we have only the plastic or that cd five or a chip
integrate some into our remote control something like a light
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology
colours they can be more money too bad These And the shapes and then they can have different assembly
distinctive look and feel and you look they do Which people the young people want to be different from their friends
tomatoes and It's that easy they're rubber is expensive
Generally add developed quite a broad concept of the interface we used and if there is some supplements
flat different colours Depending on what is around like what colours around and depending on the temperature
mark the user interface design
ready in the post and down to locate then we have to go for some speaker
follow smart should be some not too complicated
location and these people are really interesting on those features or they really like They're more want these fancy features
sixty then you make a lot of money are you don't and you're out of business
chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive they feel is colour lcd
titanium smelling like fruit or do we make spongy on one that animal A chip
Strangely enough it's more important thing it has to be fancy have to have a fancy look-and-feel and then interestingly
propose but the use of solar cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy would solar cells hand
end we find out that it's not feasible in terms of sponginess
story that for the point before why not the rubber i some rubber parts
bone shape it has to be more wrong than the More roo look natural
record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
plastic we stick last time
friends you can travel from golf to furniture so it might be fruit and vegetable
fruit these teams can be easily incorporate
recogniser but we want to goals speaker independent or speaker dependent
reduce the cost on the display would only be displayed and not a touch sensitive
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
phone we can use the phone as a good to Example of work to it beeps back
trend i hope i'm going to try to help you want that this is more risky
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
meeting are on the them first and component concept so what energy and the media and the interface for energy
feel most warlike we can test
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning
red goes faster than the life
work together a menu on a prototype using modelling clay
body one call really come up with our forties
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that Mark and then sandy
puts lots of concentrate
straight on these individual action
