lots of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
cost we should just go for push buttons would recharge the battery
press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional button
screen menu of your channel traces then you can scroll down on the scrolling
main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as or the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu
people to be able to use it as a remote control get a certain amount of a light
simply it's cheaper to make pushbuttons and it is a scroll button
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel flipping and then the other white
tend to watch tv in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
circuit board and chip we can have a simple one a regular chip
sit there and stand control the television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen then back up at your tv and people
intrigued by the idea of the scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
options of using the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
properties of the user interface and we'll come back to the chip
case out of plastic them the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
essentially we need to choose how is this device going to work
curve of a case we could do a flat which flat case the curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
tv if you're changing the brightness on trying to see it happening
shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours we could colour
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
examine each element separately but we're designing
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries
end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
find a way to protect on the inside
double curved like would that be like two hands time i am imagining
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
conceptual design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
stressing more talking we then talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
small tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
fashion watchers in paris and milan comments on some things that are gonna be go on this year
list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
research has been carried out by real reaction company wind focus on fashion
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
envisioning more like the material like you have when you said megabytes of also it doesn't hurt
saved it this in the shared project
