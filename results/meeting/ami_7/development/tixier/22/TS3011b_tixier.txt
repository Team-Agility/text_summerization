device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find the remote control
dec design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
method of the remote control so we might want to build in the future to support them Some audio signal like one phones
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume
multi function and remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
easier way of a round button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
user interface i come up with And easy remote control and the advanced remote control
functions and the money that we can say from that we should use for having a design and thinking about the user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
imagine when you only have a set like to go there and you have about six on the channel switching
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to change the channel
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set would have such a device control
stick for volume control and channel selection is the most important function In one button
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
important thing for people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control
decided to implement this a function and can be implemented in in our design
important button And there are lots of people do not always want to use the voice
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip set a circuit board so i'm not questioning
buttons like that which are easy to use rc is the best one possibility
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
focusing on younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound
user interface connect to chip which is connected to free things user interface
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board
list of Functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all function available device
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment
cell phone just one like in the device which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution
chip which just a voice recognition our circuit board will become even more cheap
big advantage in making it more elaborate by implement a speech techniques voice recognition
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
buy personally we should infer use infrared
production cost rr in just a part of the equipment
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness and it can be more trendy in and use design
device in a light roll it charges
hands like a turning on and off the light and techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
important point is that we really should use energy friendly components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger part is forty percent of the market
generates a few times within that a certain period of time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
top goal of this meeting is to reach call on the product on the target group and the functions of the remote control
older you might want to constrain that portion market would respond to a simple
watching a movie it would can see beep
home station for base station next a tv is a bus with nancy
summary of all things are spoken and the different possibilities we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
power saving will be a bit more difficult so we can expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
