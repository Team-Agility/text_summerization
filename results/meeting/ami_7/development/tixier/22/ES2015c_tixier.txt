buttons are you don't necessarily need to have it on remote
parts maybe transparent around the buttons or just the push button
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons on and the shape was so some that's that are be pressing like a volume but instead of that one button
cost of buttons what functions will show
back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control
depending on what kinds of the design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
actual remote would be hard plastic and put it in rubber can get on top
casing is that would be were rubber encapsulate in all of these Chips and diodes and delicate technology
phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons
remote control would be cheaper design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface
plates in this meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design
decided that the command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point
wimp should see what the success of the first Face plates are busily to keep in mind
change the buttons so one same colour just to keep it to the simplest o'clock
user interface design so those are the trendy and we still have the money
Pop in tarot will have to work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television that people will be movie remote
symbol of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power
complicated and the controls would be more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic energy
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
source that are that's quite an advanced would have to go with a lcd c display
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be technologically innovative
silly if we do point to have anything else just have to not important
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
strip it down to like really basic shape
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
sie it's like at the same rubber would just be that what's in contact with the human eye
regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at ed
titanium is not to be possible in know it just to be on top budget
weapon for the simple the weight that was the advanced chip was supposed to simple
brings it thing we need to be recharged and the bulk the size
due to the fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
amount of time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual components so we'd have to get it in separately
Display anyway you that will probably won't have to focus so much not be more than the numbers
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentation
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user
lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat
grapes think that's number two years and then the students
diodes transistors resonators resistors and passes it could pass it is all need to be considered
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real
power which we've been sitting inside a building
popular thing we came up out of your market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
audio settings mono stereo pitch
personal coach will be the best of the information We need to start making some more specific decisions
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost report
