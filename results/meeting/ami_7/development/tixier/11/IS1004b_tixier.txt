research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
list people are what it about the shape of the remote control
remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech recognition
younger people that gonna wanna buy a very stylish a remote control what's new technology is the people are we gonna have what i was internet connection
remote as one bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost
focusing on television but still like a universal remote control or is this something for a reminder of televisions
people want to be l to find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
present this presentation that is what we want the remote control have been have remain the same for the last five ten years
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
simplest thing the remote to change the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad
speech recognition system as a wide and really quite a microphone also to be sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find
point because actually having all that some of the remotes out there this is quite although our price
meeting about the functional design
limiting the number of button this is that operating our universal remote control or a meeting
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press a button
idea but as a marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition
contacts with people and tv or we have control of the tv to superimpose that is this menu
pretty wide range of remote control shouldn't be very they have looked pretty comfortable if you want to get this and on top
young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
red so if you go to the market and you say that buttons which are not betty
priced a remote control it would really be worth us on that would be worth implementing
restrict the remote control to tv only because of time but on the On the chip
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition gets in the way more than that helps
work it does work was supposed to work on and so on the working design issues
buttons it increases the difficulty of find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen just for changing channel numbers easily
functions which have a couple of the round buttons down to a minimum but not quite that interfere with the functionality of the device
cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
programmes on off and you what channel already what's on If you have a list
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
working design is so user interface could be of two things one is the usual
feed the targets in front of cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons
focus more on the internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be really small
teletext but we want to get read one of four requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology switch at existing so deeply the book would be which is the easiest
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
la is that the court is sitting similarly there are different interfaces
people to use on line which a case of by speak buttons out of something which is really everybody's the red
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
bring testing sings i have seen them on the one that's got a welcome pick it or is this we'll that we can use to navigate
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
scd e still on this get used to open about this cd
forces you had a company which is putting the fashion in electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
selling the potential of the device in use a potentially you can then do a look like change the lights and i close the windows what about the heating
names that we could decide fall just to get something fun for our project we should we could discuss quickly Any ideas
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting the green one and it can watch
english it sounds like them and school you know men
imagine also that's the microphone it would be an ambiance and that and then it's microphones
mount the for the naming we see fault for the look-and-feel later so let's go for this representation
