kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people are bit colour blind
sums up all the button which can hide in the back button and a menu button
prefer to be even keep the simple buttons here and then under the screen tv you can put more advanced buttons
basic print
focus on the basic look and feel design for the for the buttons
colours you where you can make it so make the colours that let's beneath the buttons

background the bright colour colours to give you an idea
button to flip it open and then you have two buttons are on top here a flip
decided to go for the pushbuttons for the arrow button that you scroll which is done with the arrows and then confirm
blue and then very bright yellow banana or and or a it's a green apple
primary colours we can creative that that the leds on the remote control should be easy
case that there's an menu under the menu
display we will put in here the basic functions and here where it's most reachable

background is very dark blue or so the contrast with the fruit of texas are pretty
buttons aren't that there are plastic because then you can light up the light on it but use it in a user interaction
yellow and orange and red and green actually the easiest to discriminate even for colour blind

important thing i was think about this speech commands if the functions that are already present
easy to use buttons we have to we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold
hardware inside which is so it has to have some basic shape
advanced chip on print to be able to support the screen and have audio function
responsible enough to have a mobile phone also to do with their remote to the control
fall on the other side of the top side but also the side few sites you on the deck
vds but this is the simple functions will be visible
important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel instead of the current functional look and feel
single curved let's say would be a square box with the with curve someone did mention and double
speech display it sounds everything that in your minutes left before the meeting
people where it isn't much like in scandinavia they wouldn't be able to use it a half the year

imagine that the kinetic a time energy source we have four types of the basic battery
drawing that's where you have to shape for your thumb
arts materials rubber it can be done you can harm
energy source chip type case type and s user interface but i didn't see a clear distinction
discourage You two are going to work on smart board

Track the pictures into the slide so i don't have examples
partly but you have to train on the number or the sign
factors involved in choosing the components
produce it in a china so it's no problem so my point of attention is a space be disbarred
