easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
incorporated in the screen or just on the remote
basic function if you are going to use the advanced one but a lot of options
menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
easy so for just a zapping around channels you can just push one button and one navigation button
position of what functions are are going to to be on the screen is also more essential
zapping which are a remote control you can press the menu button and then you are certainly into the the display
led lights on the button so that if you press on the menu in the lcd screen
functional aspects of the remote in my department
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional functionality
feel of the left example and then the screen is on top looks more But logical to me also because people
normal function the basic functions you normally press
time you have one button is also like a to confirm a action
reach a little bit for the power button but that's present channel volume selection are teletext
press a button and the teacher a goes It it sends a signal to a chip which are translates
concentrate more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen is below and the buttons are in the middle
people use mobile phone and also have a screen on top
navigate the channels and left or right for the volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program the channels in the right order
time to learn how to use a new remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
tvs in standby people just press the channel frequency or your tv and that if you will Translated into a function
plug in the power cable when you go back it's only two extra buttons
week or on the channel and then it just say is which number do you want to save
department do we need just the functional display and for curses
younger users are more acquainted with these machines so they can use more advanced functions
channel five on channel five and phone account channel anything you want to move the only kind to channel
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design of the remote
optional maybe you can go left or right end up and down in a in one menu
save this and you just press the number in a remote and then say a confirm and then it's a it's easier
idea because then it becomes clear about the extra two buttons or active
remote like this if you put it on the top and then make the corporate logo
match the operating behaviour of the users are not afraid of a lot of functions or make the buttons as user-friendly
features the above forty people are not so interests and to not interested in the screen and the speech recognition
functions and on the Seems was it the target that's a group so it's above forty
visuals of the bride this with that sliding bar and the boss and the like that for sound and then within sounds i trouble i'm base you need to change
irrelevant the less use for audio settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour etcetera
screen this you been option to go back to it to upper level which twos and focus
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
elderly people of sixteen are quite used to technology so they adapted
clear distinction between age groups concerning the features but we just have to build them in because they find
microphone it can be very small phones are just are some stripes a little holes
problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway and lots of the times there is a brand present
skip that because that's all the news flash also stated that so it should control only one device only your television
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television it's difficult but that's not hard to write
product should reach a new market which is the customers below forty
spend a lot of time thinking about what i was gonna do and then a couple minutes before this i get my fun to the information
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
received an email so i'd like we'll use so i'd just drop it in the folder
skip this price as because i read a ball forty so we could skip the features
work for thirty minute ago
threw it at transformer it's the signal gets a boost that and then sent to the receiver on the tv
lli d and then just was typing it so that all i have to that so switch
mit v doesn't have any cue equalising
