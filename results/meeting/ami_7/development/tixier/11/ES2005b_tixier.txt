functions of the users in their remote controls we should emphasise but actually can do more hard for the operate better than making it too complicated
activate the remote control it applies to something and it glows in the dark about this sectors
built since the tv there which might make a remote control of the obsolete
add speech recognition as as the glow in the dark and ball these factors will have the locating the remote control
Seventy five percent of the country where they find too difficult to operate a remote control
find it that was more like in a few watching a fill in the dark you can still see the remote control
remote controls and we should provide close by problem and no suffice to use also so as that they would go there was could easily lead
feature which which is brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection future for when you lose your remote like people
market for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros
cutting edge company we will have alternatives like speech recognition in terms of the interference and not working
remote control know what's been produced by the television which i'm presuming means is for specific television
setting is really very important point it's if we look at the market those people
concerned way of What effect be a greater should have on the user interface designer i'm concerned
complicated design should be appropriate should be good looking for the consumers and that for this the remote controls
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television set that so people
durable and that can also be economic and it kinda feels a bit different from a lot of remote controls the rubber
functions for tv but as you pointed out people between twenty five and thirty five where the main and by is of rtv
miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and how it fixed
appears that the user interface for this to be just a bunch of buttons
problems of the balloon was are facing the existing remote controls in the market survey on consumers was bound to find
exist it's not very widely use i don't think easy find a with a whistle functional
mentioned that the current products don't always match users operating behaviour
button it's hard to tell from here what they're actually do and they really very exciting
work for a while though because of this noise reference problem they mentioned
important because tft of just released is it at a remote control to the mail in a big
buttons and as much point out only ten percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons
rafts there marketing research
mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people like glow in the dark
jotted down some notes as to what it needs and what kind a novel features we can add to differentiate our product
remote for to switch the channel and being sent is that they're quite interested in tft display interactive display
electronics so we as the company we want to make a product trendy in fashions a big concern
users of data more a tv and then also made it pick up the noise and turn
work with all these product i have a great deal of experience with the industrial designer
low tech and not too many buttons set appeal on to consideration
noise over certain threshold on a topic up as a distress signal on from you and i'll be back
listed options we hand that they require of that it's very hard
position alloys that's the bells and whistle we gotta come up with a gimmick but not too complicated
chance to the tft or the lcd thing is if you're also wanting
Paul in the dark is that with a light inside that or is that go in that are material
week as we said colours and fashion were important so maybe just like little line this around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour
realistically then we need a product that's got some kind an ft outer casing cheap plastic
Small logo with the la is more yellow strip forty year low skilled in the logo
nineteen euro is we've got our we've got make a profit
shout your command to it do it for you if it's within what i'm hearing range
major factor to load take into consideration when i was a profit or our aims
house or say that in this a day in this part of view also we have pretty clear
decided in the last meeting which were essentially just a lead to have a self connecting break
organic shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corner don't feel just as gimmicky
phone of my head programmable options which just requires more not a memory
cut the classes once i hit
opposed to with batteries we don't need to provide all we pride fast batteries but it's more it's that's cheaper to justify battery
update but it anyway so your hand held portable
