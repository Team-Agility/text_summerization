lots of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
economics it's probably better to push buttons would recharge the battery
box is where you press the centre button
button to switch off in case you get bored
screen menu then we can scroll down on the scrolling
main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as or the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu
people to be able to use it as a remote control
simply it's cheaper to make pushbuttons and it is a scroll thing would be too fast
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel
tend to watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv and watch
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
decided on like a simple a regular chip
sit there and stand control the television from your armchair
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen
intrigued by the idea of the scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
money into the like the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
interface and we'll come back to the chip
case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display
shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
member of that this is the device itself is useful purpose
curve of a case we could do a flat which flat case the curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
tv if you're changing the brightness on trying to see it happening
shaped like a vegetable colours we could colour
number of different choices for a design concept and start
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
examine each element separately but we're designing
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
determine what the essential functions of the device
care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries
end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
find a way to protect on the inside
double curved like would that be like two hands time
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
conceptual design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
minute or if you the minutes left of the meeting
stressing more talking we then talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
small tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
work together on a prototype using modelling clay
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
plastic but we have all these fashion and simplicity so if we're going for fashion
list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
research has been carried out by real reaction company wind focus on fashion
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
envisioning more like the material like you have when you said megabytes of also it doesn't hurt
saved it this in the shared project
