jane do we tend to do a speech just for the basic options for buttons
kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people
sums up all the button and a menu button
prefer to be even keep the simple buttons
basic print
focus on the basic design for the for the buttons
colours you where you can make it so make the colours spongy
bet it that's better keep the left and the button itself in the same colour i so just an extra protection
bright colour colours to give you an idea
button because maybe if you flip it open
decided to go for the pushbuttons for the arrow button
blue and then very bright yellow banana or and or a it's a green apple
investigation again in the remote control should be easy
case that there's an menu under the menu
display we will put in here the basic functions
appeal to the young public want soft primary colours and with a lot of shape
dark blue or so the contrast with the fruit of texas are pretty
buttons aren't that there are plastic because then you can light up the light
red and green actually the easiest to discriminate even for colour blind
components there's a lot of options are for the menu
aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative
back light and dark
case there's the traditional uncurved flat hard case single curved
fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothing and shoes and furniture and it feels material
match the speech commands if the functions that are already present
easy to use buttons we have to we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold
hardware inside which is so it has to have some basic shape
chip on print to be able to support the screen and have audio function
responsible enough to have a mobile phone has to work for the remote control
fall on the other side of the real
vds but this is the simple functions will be visible
important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel the case and the interface
single curved let's say would be a square box with the with curve
read i read the minutes left before the meeting
older people don't have to ever buy batteries
easier to integrate the lcd screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches
possibilities from our manufacturing department about screens components which will have to be implemented in the design of the actual products
covered that with our screen and and speech recognition
standard traditional type where the forum search the function
kinetic energy source we have four types of the basic battery
drawing that's where you have to shape for your thumb
materials rubber it can be done you can harm
interface but i didn't see a clear distinction
discourage You two are going to work on smart board
feel weird if you would make this smaller and it's a bigger
drawing you think i'm not gonna be able to put a screen
call meaning so that's a dark
feels material is expected to be spongy sell
knew that i didn't have time so copy and paste
Track the pictures into the slide so i don't have examples
partly but you have to train on the number
factors involved in choosing the components
laugh you can look at the final reports
scared about pounds get out the floor and breaking
cut the bases into the other folder
