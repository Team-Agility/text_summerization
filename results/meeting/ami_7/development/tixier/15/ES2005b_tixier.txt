people most of teams and people they find that the remote control
companies that thing that they show them what are more functions of the users in their remote controls
remote control it applies to something and it glows in the dark about this sectors
built since the tv there which might make a remote control of the obsolete
consumers they're willing to have pay more for speech recognition in a remote control
Seventy five percent of the country where they find too difficult to operate a remote control
find it that was more like in a few watching a fill in the dark you can still see the remote control
remote controls and we should provide close by problem of the remote control
feature which which is brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature or noise
market ancient art of how we should design can do other remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros
talk about speech recognition in terms of the interference and not working
remote control know what's been produced by the television which i'm presuming
setting is really very important point it's if we look at the market those people
concerned way of What effect be a greater should have on the user
care of this vector also like our design should be appropriate should be good looking for the consumers
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television set that so people
kinda feels a bit different from a lot of remote controls the rubber
functions for tv but as you pointed out people between twenty five and thirty five where the main and by is of rtv
miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design
canonical user interface for this to be just a bunch of buttons
methodology a doctor to find out of this it was market a detailed
exist it's not very widely use i don't think easy find a with a whistle functional
mentioned that the current products don't always match users operating behaviour
limit the number of button and if you hit that menu the top
work for a while though because of this noise problem they mentioned
press the pick want to get on to the big seven inch big screen
telephone that fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons
rafts there marketing research
mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people like glow in the dark
told us that Consumers are willing to spend more for fancy product
encoding i'm getting from little bits of what channel or to turn the tv
electronics so we as the company we want to make a product trendy in fashions a big concern
watching the tv and then also made it pick up the noise and turn
work with all these product i have a great deal of experience with the industrial designer
low tech and not too many buttons set appeal on to consideration
noise over certain threshold on a topic up as a distress signal on from you and i'll be back
listed options we hand that they require of that it's very hard
bells and whistle we gotta come up with a gimmick but not too complicated
chance to the tft or the lcd thing is if you're also wanting
material is Maybe not this a tail maybe more like this work for a materials
colours and fashion were important so maybe just like little line this around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour
realistically then we need a product that's got some kind an ft outer casing cheap
logo on as bright yellow strip forty year low skilled in the logo
nineteen euro is we've got our we've got make a profit
shout your command to it do it for you if it's within what i'm hearing range
major factor to load take into consideration when i was a profit sense
house or say that in this a day in this part of view also we have pretty clear
respect to tell you about the changes before the meeting and then we ended
organic shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corner don't feel just as gimmicky
phone of my head programmable options which just requires more not a memory
cut the classes once i hit
opposed to with batteries we don't need to provide all we pride fast batteries but it's more it's that's cheaper to justify battery
update but it anyway so your hand held portable
