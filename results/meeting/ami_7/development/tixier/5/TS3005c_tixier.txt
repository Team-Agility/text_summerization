pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour
form of the remote control a lot of people we'll i dropped remote control on a break
decision on the remote control concepts
easier to do in colour than a shape
miss possible to the g you just put in a row underneath it on the bottom of the remote
menu or just you just wanted to know the volume we should also be enough for easy
japanese people the rubber small hands
small because you have how much nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen
determine that there will not be no but that's but only an lcd screen as large as the remote control itself yelling
hand there and then you want touch the screen
called like what's the trends from past years what colour shapes colours Material and elderly people
button you are pressing the right moment
big difference between young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
important position the people can see it because it is the unique
rise to shine and rubber the total piece of rubber that makes it easy to to tune that's it's of colour so if you scratch
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
buy Not faster when they look the same old grey or black the colours but you should have a standard colour
screen they don't need that big so it's it's really an important function of the remote
buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button on the bottom of standbys
hand i did single covered the curved remote control
scroll cs or if you have a lot of options appearing on the screen the colour nations
option to use as a in a rather simple lcd screen
shape like a week you said is that's easy better or for the elderly people something like that Like the ipod do something with the round
discussed in the earlier that's all of people don't really want to use these extra settings
personal preferences for the young people like a fruity colours Innovative all the colleges you blue red and brown
hard part of this or soft with the material like the rubber should be soft
tie That what you'd like to do on the screen is want to go back from the floor
elderly people like a plain normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
touchscreen makes it possible to get to go nation of your finger on screen the case
easy to have it something like but and minus here the sofa here Minus
printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal print
questions about the design and user interface there are going to work together on for a foundering a smartboard
settings menu great with the scroll down on a menu which probably does not fit on a screen
colour titanium or you have to pay chip and we have that's it's possible to scratchy
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to press it in its feels kinda
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard material like wood the titanium
switch it just from the previous meeting that they should we should use our own business colours
chip on print think cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
conceptual design meeting which is you were opened
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
find something in the middle ground that square and round corners put a little in the middle
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
sense that it you ask you give a question mark how much we spy thing with Energy
lasting not not be anti it's a two minutes or thirty minutes of forty minutes of use Nx
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
findings in new technology for speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
recharge through docking station
record into the device into the speaker
schools it is in the actual design
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
edit issue to remove degrees
today we once again have a three presentation is once again or at least an agenda
