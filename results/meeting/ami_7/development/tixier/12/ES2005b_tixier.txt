remote control know what's been produced by the television
setting is really very important point it's if we look at the market those people
concerned way of What effect be a greater should have on the user interface
industrial designer my job is to take in input
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television

hand that they require of that it's very hard
work if we had its bells and whistles
cheaper than tft it's just a microphone and some integrated circuits
material is Maybe not this a tail maybe more like this work for a materials

basic are frequency so i'll be cheap
integrating the rabbit integrate the logo
