lots of people complain they kind can find your remote control
dec design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
unique feature of a remote control and start a beep
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume
multi function and remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
easier way of a round button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
user interface i come up with And easy remote control
user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
push a button to switch the channel imagine
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to change the channel
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set would have such a device control
relevance scale the channel selection is the most important
support teletext is out of date and the internet
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs
important thing for people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control
decided to implement this a function the technical design
people do not always want to use the voice
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip set a circuit board
easy on the inside or elaborate on your opinion
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
focusing on younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound
user interface connect to chip which is connected to free things user interface
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board
list of Functions decide it and our target audience
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment
cell phone just one like in the device to incorporates this technique
market is interested in some advanced new techniques
sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution
cheap to incorporate integrated circuit board will become even more cheap
expensive and they're hard to implement a speech techniques voice recognition
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
buy personally we should infer use infrared
production cost rr in just a part of the equipment
goal was a boston move you would like to start
find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness
device in a light roll it charges
hands like a turning on and off the light and techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
important point is that we really should use energy friendly components
younger part is forty percent of the market
time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our product on the target group and the functions of the remote control
older you might want to constrain that portion market
watching a movie it would can see beep
base station next to see this a little antenna
summary of all things are spoken and the different possibilities
expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
