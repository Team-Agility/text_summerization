hundred a new remote control is quite subjective experience
sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control
talk about the technical functions design objectives
designing a new television remote controls in the analysing
chip which is also controlled by the user
parts of the working design presentation i have a pet
personally what i want from a remote control what we want to do it sends a message
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
users using a remote control hear she expects the buttons to be in certain places
lots of buttons and that might be older people
chip through the use of the user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
working designers figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
frozen he can show me to pick up the remote
designed to like this you have your energy source
control so it's one has got lots of buttons
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote
people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume
pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicate
feel like voice recognition was inverse be related to age
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
sends a opinions to the television and the power
includes an emphasis on making the infrared very functional
clear idea of an lcd screen was brought
easiest thing to do is gonna be work
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device
target group that means that is very few we need to each group
find out find a way of striking a balance
fifty percent of the people mention that was the biggest
marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying
receiver and in my opinion infrared
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
button on the tv you can press the middle ring
putting on them in the shared folder
economic we need to find a wheel between features and price
examples probably at the extreme end of the spectrum
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple
battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
number to make it technologically the end of select
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
worry about four minutes left to define our functions
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
price limit of the twelve and a half euro without having to make too many of a compromise
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
Switch the quality a quality of the chair
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
charging station like a mobile phone Or like a little cradle for your ipod
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
