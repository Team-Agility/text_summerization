pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour
form of the remote control a lot of people we'll i dropped remote control on a break
decision on the remote control concepts
easier to do in colour than a shape
decided to have to remotes to the size
menu or just you just wanted to know the volume
japanese people the rubber small hands
small because you have how much nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the lcd screen
advantages of lcd screen it right and you can draw
hand there and then you want touch the screen
called like what's the trends from past years what colour shapes colours Material and elderly people
button you are pressing the right moment
young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
people can see it because it is the unique
rise to shine and rubber the total piece of rubber
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
buy Not faster when they look the same old grey or black the colours
screen they don't need that big of cpu
chip on print what they mean with the regular rubber buttons
idea of making it And one single curved
scroll cs or if you have a lot of options
option to use as a in a rather simple chip
square shape sit around got on the round
discussed in the earlier that's all of people don't really want to use these extra settings
fruity colours Innovative all the colleges you blue red and brown
round shapes As soft with the material like the rubber
tie That what you'd like to do on the screen is want to go back
elderly people just plain old because we decided
touchscreen makes it possible to get to go nation of your finger on screen the case
easy way to a program that you say record
printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal print
graphical user interface there are going to work together on for a foundering a smartboard
change a scroll down on a menu which probably does not fit on a screen
chip and we have that's it's possible to scratchy
rubber which you can look and feel weird
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard material
switch it just from the previous meeting and busy writing
cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
conceptual design meeting which is you were opened
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
square and round corners put a little in the middle
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
charges itself lot instead of plan yalina something like that questions
meeting is once again in thirty minutes we have forty minutes to accomplish
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
lose the pen if you lose the pen
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
recharge through docking station
record into the device into the speaker
schools it is in the actual design
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
edit issue to remove degrees
