jane do we tend to do a speech just for the basic options for buttons
press a button then you can disable the colour
sums up all the button and a menu button
prefer to be even keep the simple buttons
basic print
focus on the basic design for the for the buttons
colours you where you can make it so make the colours spongy
bet it that's better keep the left and the button with the one coloured
bright colours to give you an idea
button because maybe if you flip it open

aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative
back light and dark
picture of doubly curved so Rubber
fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothing and shoes and furniture and it feels material
match the speech commands if the functions that are already present
easy to use buttons we have to we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold
hardware inside which is so it has to have some basic shape
chip on print to be able to support the screen and have audio function
responsible enough to have a mobile phone has to work for the remote control

single curved let's say would be a square box with the with curve
read the minutes left before the meeting
people where it isn't much like in scandinavia they wouldn't be able to use it a half the year
easier to integrate the lcd screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches

feel weird if you would make this smaller and it's a bigger
drawing you think i'm not gonna be able to put a screen
