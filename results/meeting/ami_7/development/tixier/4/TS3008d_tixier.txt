Remote controls not be how do you feel
remote control where it was useful to have a kind a like power source
special button when you're talking about at this just a signal
televisions that we have the remote control supplied as you can do the buttons with a one and a dash into a dash but when you use but the remote control hasn't got too much redundant or i needed buttons
remote control gives a signal at the one button on the remote control within five seconds
logo is It's It's pretty all the used to see on the remote control
form we should mark special remote control dunno which is forms special material
single it in the first place this is signal which it would also sent we put a separate button
docking station and probably we also have only we also need a simple chip
big deal but the remote control gets why did a state
euros then we have so maybe we have to use the advanced chip
push a button it sends it immediately to the television there will be one and align it which is it and displaced
problem now is that the There's no such thing as a docking station and pretty players
deem them must be innovative technology for remote controls one more in our you controls not in how you finder
adjust the two buttons we place them in the middle the menu and for the teletext
special we looked at the form colours and colour or give them a special
imagine that would be impossible to make a docking station for two euros and thirty cents
special material also because of rubber buttons have to be rubber
open the specially them all gonna work
docking station anyway because we have some cost and such are not included in this list
's technical function tv functionality of that's a separate button when you wanna find
simple chip and with the retriever a device it will costa a bit more like a high in the advanced chip
push the one you can show on the telly it a one and just that there's no way it's it's it's a cat
simple chip then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents
remote control nowadays are they come with the television need to be input first nn
double curved case a low for a remote control is at least one euro
fifty cents a button
buttons will be that will be matching colour as the rubber on the side
kinetic thing we could do to do a compromise in which you can kinetic
build your company for it to a level higher
kinetic part as to get some Just to give it some extra special future
sophisticated than on tv technology that it will give more signals It could work
display requires a simple chip but the scroll wheel in it requires you if you vision
remote controls that down at these buttons but you still can know you can still select the twenty a number in the twenty times an hour
positive things has to be on the left so i said not oddly instead of lively
power device is very cheap that's just a regular
rubber parts and it's the readiness of thing and then when you move the round of my notes
calculator also works on our own solar cells more projects than only remote controls
Fill in the number of components you guys using the five minute of the cost
excel in on the in the range in the field of design and the looks and feel
question is usable it will be bought by people under the age of forty
middle there's hard to hard material have a hard plastic with a light on the top
call a lot of problems The sample sensor slash sample speaker
leave it open for for there's you are because we have to reevaluate
eighty percent of the price of of the amount of components of truth specific point
display is for some numbers for some text
profit as you would twelve and a half production costs
lowest part of it so when it's the same as the other products go deeper
foley own it's site and the other side that will be a strip of rubber and in the middle
job in the first me to afford to do your first presentation to make this clear but then you have some time problems
important part of these meeting
gotta fill out a questionnaire to be honest
add a discourse now to cr to laugh
moment rome reborn
tend to hear a bell
