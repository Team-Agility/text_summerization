hundred a new remote control is quite subjective experience
sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control
talk about the technical functions design objectives
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote control
chip which is also controlled by the user
controlling most of the working design they need to be figured
personally what i want from a remote control what we want to do it sends a message
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
users using a remote control hear she expects the buttons to be in certain places
appeal to people are only using ten percent of the buttons and that might be older people
chip through the use of the user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
working designers figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
frozen he can show me to pick up the remote all they want like an upgrade
combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
control so it's one has got lots of buttons could be yellow but we can play
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume freeze frame
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
older people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition
complicate like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
breaks i was given in terms of each was the voice recognition but at the price
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
button that allows us to do certain effects on the television and the power
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
shared a quite a bit rate anyone wants to work on each task a step
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
deadline the target group that means that is very few we need to each group
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d data is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
receiver and in my opinion infrared
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
putting on them in the shared folder
economic we need to find a wheel and for me as to what rsi
instruction manual it comes at the end that's and hot because of the combination
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
price limit of the twelve and a half euro without having to make too many of a compromise
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
charging station like a mobile phone Or like a little cradle for your ipod
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
