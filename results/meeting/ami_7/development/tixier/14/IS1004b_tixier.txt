research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
list people are what it about the shape of the remote control
remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech recognition
people that gonna wanna buy a very stylish a remote control
remote as one bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost
focusing on television remote control or is this something for a reminder of televisions
people want to be l to find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
control have been have remain the same for the last five ten years
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
simplest thing the remote to change the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad
speech recognition system as a wide and really quite a microphone also to be sitting on the remote
point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
meeting about the functional design
number of button to enter to do and then the summer
press a button to talk and the tvt v set
requirements i'd give it a marketing report is to tv remote court
tv or we have control of the tv to superimpose that is this menu
scroll was actually pretty a pretty wide range of remote controls
young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
red so if you go to the market and you say that buttons which are not betty
priced a remote control it would really be worth us on that would be worth implementing
control to tv only because of time but on the On the chip
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition
work it does work was supposed to work on the components concepts
buttons it increases the difficulty of find out a solution
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen
live in a little in each of the the main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared of lcd
move to another does it because i twenty five dollars
programmes on off and you what channel already what's on If you have a list
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
work and user interface could be off more than one type
feed the targets in front of cost it's not possible to goals two lcd
button interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
focus more on the internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
seoul extend past the hand shape and it should not be really small
requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
la is that the court is sitting similarly there are different interfaces
people to use on line which a case of by speak
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
brings us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet capability
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
master a very easy to handle to scroll not too big
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
scd e still on this get used to open to discussion
electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
selling the potential of the device You'll do we have problems
eds they're more like and they good idea is to it looks like a year
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting the green one and it can watch
english it sounds like them and school you know men
imagine also that's the microphone it would be an ambiance and that and then it's microphones
mount the for the naming we see fault for the look-and-feel later so let's go for this representation
set ninety five percent
