kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people
button which can hide in the back button and a menu button
prefer to be even keep the simple chip just for pressing buttons
basic print
focus on the basic design for the for the buttons
colours you where you can make it so make the colours spongy
bet it that's better keep the left and the button with the one coloured
background the bright colour colours to give you an idea
button to flip it open and then you have two buttons to control to combination
decided to go for the pushbuttons for the arrow button
blue and then very bright yellow banana or and or a it's a green apple
remember from whatever first meetings that people lose their remote control
case that there's an menu under the menu
display we will put in here the basic functions and here where it's most reachable
appeal to the young public want soft primary colours and with a lot of shape
dark blue or so the contrast with the fruit of texas are pretty
buttons aren't that there are plastic because then you can light up the light
shows for the battery and traditional and that's the most obvious easiest to discriminate even for colour blind people because of that of the green
components there's a lot of options on your a remote control
aspect was twice as important as the second aspect what which was twice as important as the fruit aspect
back light and dark
case there's the traditional uncurved flat hard case single curved
fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothing and shoes and furniture and it feels material
match the speech commands if the functions that are already present
easy to use buttons we have to we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold
hardware inside which is so it has to have some basic shape
chip on print to be able to support the screen and have audio function
responsible enough to have a mobile phone has to work for the remote control
fall on the other side of the top side but also the side few sites you on the deck
vds but this is the simple functions will be visible
important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel the case and the interface
single curved let's say would be a square box with the with curve
speech display it sounds everything that in your minutes left before the meeting
people where it isn't much like in scandinavia they wouldn't be able to use it a half the year
easier to integrate the lcd screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches
cells but i how we would use that into the design of the actual products
technolo technological innovation we covered that with our screen and and speech recognition
standard traditional type where the forum search the function
kinetic energy source we have four types of the basic battery
drawing that's where you have to shape for your thumb
arts materials rubber it can be done you can harm
energy source chip type case type and s user interface but i didn't see a clear distinction
discourage You two are going to work on smart board
feel weird if you would make this smaller and it's a bigger
drawing you think i'm not gonna be able to put a screen
call meaning so that's a dark
sell it for twenty five euro a piece that's gonna be difficult
knew that i didn't have time so copy and paste
Track the pictures into the slide so i don't have examples
partly but you have to train on the number or the sign
factors involved in choosing the components
produce it in a china so it's no problem so my point of attention is a space be disbarred
scared about pounds get out the floor and breaking
cut the bases into the other folder
