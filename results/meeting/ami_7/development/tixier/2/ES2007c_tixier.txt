squeezing of the rubber be the generating like the energy generator
speaker for the remote control is designs to the complete opposite
choosing a Solar cells then we can choose titanium and if we choosing
Technologically it should be like work to work on the product evaluation
fast and a very much in fruit and vegetables of them are like they have theme for cloths shoes and furniture
variety of colours that people feel like the customising it wanna buy it just by the fact that choosing
watches of a problem what we should choose so for the energy
story they're gonna see like three or four normal remote control for the room and try to thirty children
ten of power and we definitely know Tu-dum still be a simple button
sense have something that's little more technologically advanced and what's on the market
easy enough to find out what colours a more popular
run what this fda with them at eight of the material itself so it can be it a plastic or latex or rubber wood or titanium
fancy the kinetic provision of energy
State you'll get lots of people already seen it people

Technically speaking it's know as advanced but that's a job
telling it's not saying do anything stick it is so maybe you should collect
chip on print which up it was one bc And that's got all the electronics one board
part more of a profit
sample that But when you say something or whatever responding
hear about is if we finally decided
channel five and a chance like talk
manufacturing division sent some samples of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products like the coffee machine
meeting be able to come in and show us so my same physical ideas at the minutes
pushbuttons and sell it can be just simple
hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmick you wrote
