buttons are you don't necessarily need to have it on remote
parts maybe transparent around the buttons or just the push button
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
cost of buttons what functions will show
test will have to look at how the remote control
depending on what kinds of the design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
plastic and put it in rubber can get on top
casing is that would be were rubber encapsulate in all of these Chips and diodes and delicate technology
phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons
remote control would be cheaper design like look at the basic
plates in this meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design
command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point
wimp should see what the success of the first Face plates
buttons so one same colour just to keep it to the simplest o'clock
interface design so those are the trendy and we still have the money
Pop in tarot will have to work on the look and feel design
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television
symbol of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume
complicated and the controls would be more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons
kinetic energy is transformed into a power to make a circuit
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
advanced would have to go with a lcd c display
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
important aspect is that the remote control should be easy
Screen settings was use zero point five times an hour
contrast to last in the feel the material is expected to be spongy
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
strip it down to like really basic shape
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
rubber would just be that what's in contact with the human eye
regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at ed
top or a light up ideas to combat these problems
weapon for the simple regular chip was supposed to simple
brings it thing we need to be recharged and the bulk the size
fruits and vegetable things if that's going to work for us sound
amount of time lcd type of buttons we have an input
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television
Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentation
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user
lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat
grapes think that's number two years and then the students
diodes transistors resonators resistors and passes it could pass it is all need to be considered
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
dynamo which is the thing that was used to which is fifty years ago the ousted
power which we've been sitting inside a building
popular thing we came up out of your market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
audio settings mono stereo pitch
information We need to start making some more specific decisions
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost report
