people most of teams and people they find that the remote control
functions of the users in their remote controls we should emphasise but actually can do more hard for the operate better than making it too complicated
remote control it applies to something and it glows in the dark about this sectors
built since the tv there which might make a remote control of the obsolete
consumers they're willing to have pay more for speech recognition in a remote control
Seventy five percent of the country where they find too difficult to operate a remote control
find it that was more like in a few watching a fill in the dark you can still see the remote control
build spacecraft you'll have no problem of the remote control
feature which which is brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature or noise
market ancient art of how we should design can do other remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros
talk about speech recognition in terms of the interference and not working
remote control know what's been produced by the television which i'm presuming
setting is really very important point it's if we look at the market those people
concerned way of What effect be a greater should have on the user interface
care of this vector also like our design should be appropriate should be good looking for the consumers
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television
kinda feels a bit different from a lot of remote controls the rubber
functions for tv but as you pointed out people would require
miss out on the buttons organic design and how it fixed
user interface for this to be just a bunch of buttons
problems of the balloon was are facing the existing remote controls in the market survey on consumers was bound to find
exist it's not very widely use i don't think easy find a with a whistle functional
mentioned that the current products don't always match users operating behaviour
number of button and if you hit that menu the top
work for a while though because of this noise problem they mentioned
press the pick want to get on to the big
telephone that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons
rafts there marketing research
mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people like glow in the dark
told us that Consumers are willing to spend more for fancy product
encoding i'm getting from little bits of what channel and being sent is that they're quite interested in tft display interactive display
electronics so we as the company we want to make a product trendy in fashions a big concern
users of data more a tv and then also made it pick up the noise and turn
work with all these product i have a great deal of experience with the industrial designer
low tech and not too many buttons set appeal on to consideration
noise over certain threshold on a topic up as a distress signal on from you and i'll be back
listed options we hand that they require of that it's very hard
bells and whistle we gotta come up with a gimmick but not too complicated
cheaper than tft it's just a microphone and some integrated circuits
materials cheap but it's just the go on the dark your needs some like a charger
point out there are more said put the fashion in electronics
realistically then we need a product that's got some kind an ft outer casing cheap plastic
integrating the rabbit integrate the logo on as bright yellow
nineteen euro is we've got our we've got make a profit
shout your command to it do it for you if it's within what i'm hearing range
major factor to load take into consideration when i was a profit sense
house or say that in this a day in this part of view also we have pretty clear
decided in the last meeting that i have to find
organic shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corner
definite requirements that they will that we need to scroll
cut the classes once i hit
opposed to with batteries we don't need to provide all we pride fast batteries but it's more it's that's cheaper to justify battery
update but it anyway so your hand held portable
reports in the project documents it's on your desktop
practical annotations which i a threat
