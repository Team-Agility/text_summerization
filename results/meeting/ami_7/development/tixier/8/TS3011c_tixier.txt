scroll wheels because it's all curved
personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control
remote control and talking to it but it still need to points to the television
flawless Think about a scenario where you would use the scroll button
possibility for us to use scroll wheels they can be handy
hold a remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb So in that case
watching a movie and you haven't move the remote a remote control
casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved or flat case that's the most common remote can control form
note if you want to use these rubber of the case
volume button and either on the side but do you touch
scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons
high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
energy we decided chip
fruit you have to colours We have to simple design
cd displays there's no way you can integrated scroll wheels
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular
voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
spongy feel you need to to make it buttons all of rubber
fronts On which the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
finishing this is what's on the edge what you feel
buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch
fruit and vegetables are important but innovation is more important
previews i deserve voice recognition and the round buttons for the channel programming and volume
light blue and it's also a yellow
suggest we use the sensor so if you say mute
cost rating on the young group like from a material
suggest that the corporate identity should be it in the product
forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic
latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cell solution for the energy
move that's the sense of it and you can store
Point i would like to some issues that would like to point
problem here is that it's supply at the very little amount of kinetic energy
phase source and is the design of the look and feel The user interface design
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar
bet i understood that the market is decide as a little older
space in our finance i would say do integrate some functions
version of the advanced a version of the chip supports lcd that's all and we've decided
piece of this action to it's that's really the mute
devices like at telephones and are radio pocket radios
watch in a display or which channel you have chosen like that often the amount of volume
watch you watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of energy then the shaking
indicators we have the lcd displays
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
fashion watchers found out that the young target group like fruit and vegetables In their clothes shoes and furniture
bright anything down could you put it on the shared folder
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
cable go back to that slide
carpets on the wall which are natural of mean friends
afraid is not possible to print a picture or the size
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion
email is immediately start with the individual presentations the programmes
