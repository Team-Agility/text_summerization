hundred a new remote control is quite subjective experience
features that are missing from that remote their own remote controls
talk about the technical functions design objectives
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote control
chip which is also controlled by the user
parts of the working design presentation i have a pet
personally what i want from a remote control is a device that simple
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
remember that remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users
lots of buttons and that might be older people don't really care
chip through the use of the user interface is critical
technical functions presentation working design how the apparatus can fulfil its function
money to buy a new remote all they want like an upgrade
combination of electrical energy source people don't wanna be changing
large accessible buttons could be yellow but we can play
components that we find here are the energy or information to the chip
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
type numbers but you before the next meeting in terms of users
age so younger people didn't really care for voice recognition
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicated
feel like voice recognition was inverse be related to age
talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
disadvantages you can't use it say to freeze the television
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
investment should use novel idea of exactly what this product
shared a quite a bit rate anyone wants to work
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
imagine just it is an electronic device which is fairly conventional in design
deadline the target group and what are we gonna go cobble
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the people mention that was the biggest
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
receiver and in my opinion infrared
focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings adjust brightness
tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
putting on them in the shared folder
prominent as the main features and price as you mentioned
coffee at the end user is gonna want from this product
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple
battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
Sit simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes left to define our functions
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce
time you'll be able to access more of the website
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
charging station like a mobile phone Or like a little cradle for your ipod
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
