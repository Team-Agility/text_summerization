curves we can make more options for the simple buttons
press a button then you can disable the colour leds for people
buttons which can hide in the back button and a menu button
prefer to be even keep the simple chip just for pressing buttons
basic print
basic look and feel design for the for the buttons
sixty fifth a five thousand colour so you don't lose
bet it that's better keep the left and the button itself in the same colour i so just an extra
background the bright colour colours to give you an idea
menu button to flip this open it will hold expected
confirmation button scroll this is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons
green apple
primary colours we can creative that that the leds on the remote control
case that there's an menu under the menu
reread got the basic functions and here where it's most reachable
appeal to the young dynamic people want soft primary colours which looks like fruits
dark blue or so the contrast with the fruit of texas are pretty
flashing stand-by light up and then you can only change the colour also of the lights
red and green actually the easiest to discriminate even for colour blind
components there's a lot of options are for the menu
important aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative
back light
picture of doubly curved case there's the traditional uncurved flat hard case single curved
fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothing and shoes and furniture and it feels material
match the speech commands if the functions that are already present
easier to hold in your hand that's that's a problem
hardware inside which is so it has to have some basic shape
chip Is easiest to implement for the production they can print
responsible enough to have a mobile phone has to work for the remote control
falls on the other side of the top side but also the side view
vds but this is the simple functions will be visible
important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel the case and the interface
single curve someone did mention and double curved it's tearing
speech display it sounds everything that in your minutes i wrote
gave me an idea about what people that sixteen years
easier to integrate the lcd screen just into this ball
cells but i how we would use that into the design of the actual products
technolo technological innovation we covered
standard traditional type where the forum search the function
decided kinetic provision of energy source would be more expensive
drawing that's where you have to shape for your thumb
arts materials rubber it can be done you can harm
energy source chip type case type and s user interface
discourage You two are going to work on smart board
feel weird if you would make this smaller and it's a bigger
size you can be straight if you have pop up screen
call meaning so that's a dark
sell it for twenty five euro a piece that's gonna be difficult
knew that i didn't have time so copy and paste
Track the pictures into the slide so i don't have examples
partly but you have to train on the number or the sign
factors involved in choosing the components
problem so my point of attention is a space be disbarred
scared about pounds get out the floor and breaking
