ready Betty often because they lost the remote control the remote
list people are what it about the shape of the remote control
remote control Being one or beyond thing and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition
people are they are more interested they incorporating new technologies in the remote control
remote controls are used by more than one person's And as you targeting single people
simple a task in that we're only doing a television remote control
people as see a remote see that see a remote control
present this presentation that is what we want the remote control
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
simplest thing the remote control does is it just change that change the channel
automatic speech recognition technology does mean sitting on the remote
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
meeting about the functional design
application and then shape of the buttons like say the number of buttons
press a button to talk and the tvt v set
users as our marketing expert should be for some specs
tv or we have control of the tv then we can actually display
scroll was actually pretty a pretty wide range of remote controls
young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
People so complain because they all have the same size of the voters four buttons which are not betty
priced a remote control it would really be worth us on that would be worth implementing
restrict the remote control to tv only because of time
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition
work it does work was supposed to work on and so on the working
point to To find out can we increases the price
list of programmed an lcd screen just for changing channel
cd screen except for the really main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared of lcd
speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros eddie hattie
programmes on off and you what channels already what's on If you have a list
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
user interface could be of two things one is the usual
target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but there are a fancy intends to intends to had to have rarely
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons
extra internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
design should feed the hand shape and it should not be really small
requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology switch at existing
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
la is that the court is sitting similarly there are different interfaces
speak buttons out of something which is really everybody's the red
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
bring testing sings i have seen them on the one that's got a welcome pick it or is this we'll that we can use to navigate
hope that next meeting you have the task you have to work
master a very easy is assigned they could be sold
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
scd e still on this get used to open about this cd
forces you had a company which is putting the fashion in electronics
selling the potential of the device You'll do we have problems
names that we could decide fall just to get something fun for our project we should we could discuss quickly Any ideas
message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting the green one and it can watch
english it sounds like them and school you know men
imagine also that's the microphone it would be an ambiance and that and then it's microphones
naming we see fault for the look-and-feel later so let's go for this representation
