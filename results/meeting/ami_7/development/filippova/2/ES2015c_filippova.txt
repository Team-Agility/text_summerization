buttons are you don't necessarily need to have it on remote
parts maybe transparent around the buttons or just the push button
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
cost of buttons what functions will show
test will have to look at how the remote control
design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic and the casing is rubber
end so more internal casing and the rubber coating which is on the case
phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons
abstract design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface
meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design
command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
stick graphical user you must need some presentation for the graphics like an lcd
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates
change the buttons so one same colour it's face it's generated
explain what the user interface to make it more trendy
working this have to shake it a bit and revitalise
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television
numbers of the channels volume and you cannot any power
mind more design an hour more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons
cutting edge technology wise kinetic energy is a new idea
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house cat our dog
rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals
rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
important aspect is that the remote control should be easy
Screen settings was use zero point five times an hour
fancy look-and-feel and so the current functional look and feel
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
selling point that is just the basic shape
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
rubber which might be mall ideal for the anti rsi
regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
top or a light up ideas to combat these problems
weapon for the simple regular chip was supposed to simple
source is not necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg eating
method was mainly web-based research this time around i also spoke
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television
Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
powerpoint i can't remember what it's got at the components
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty
aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user
flat then i got like on a cell phone a mobile phone so called a flat
keyboard so the numbers are like a keyboard you pressing
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
looked at the design reports from previous years here real
power which we've been sitting inside a building
popular thing we came up out of your market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals
audio settings mono stereo pitch
information We need to start making some more specific decisions
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
shorter report
