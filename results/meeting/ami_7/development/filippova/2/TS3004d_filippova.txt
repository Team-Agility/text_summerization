speech buttons speech you try to sell it counts redesign
wood rubber buttons mute buttons are together and at the place to use we are used to find
flashing lights and the background lights up also not the buttons
speech the scroll wheel and the slide you miss
normal and to a normal remote controls

hard plastic is that the allows us to use that would be buttons non rubber buttons
basic colours are black or green or yellow

choose green the blue and red
turn teletext on you set the seven hundred and you'd turn it off then the next and turn it on it still stays
kinda weird a we get this information

direction because it's twelve point three euros then we would discourage
add it from just with a mouse way setting
save it on the same thing it's a map are still the ones in the project a map
roll second level wanna say all the options that are still left
fancy look-and-feel and that's what the tracks the young audience
