people most of teams and people they find that the remote control
technical know let's do see at the mall how to operate these remote controls
activate the remote control have parts and the sports book
remote control by the tv speaker and transmitter there it sends back to remote
consumers they're willing to have pay more for speech recognition in a remote control
Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote control
find the finer things it's could probably make a circuit diagram
build spacecraft you'll have no problem and no suffice to use also so as that they would go there was could easily lead
feature which which is brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection future for when you lose your remote like people
market for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros
scratch the speech recognition was a recognition and rocket power
remote it's only for the television which i'm presuming means is for specific television
setting is really very important point it's if we look at the market those people
concerned way of What effect be a greater should have on the user interface
complicated design should be appropriate should be good looking for the consumers and that for this the remote controls
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television
durable and that can also be economic and it kinda
information to rise cases was very useful but what people like what people
speak recognition limited buttons we can make up for in design
canonical user interface is just an engineering thing i regret
methodology a doctor to find out of this it was market a detailed
exist it's not very widely use i don't think easy find
mentioned that the current products don't always match users operating behaviour
number of buttons do the one button for a fancy
work for a while though because of this noise problem they mentioned
leaving remote control for presentations so and a big grey
telephone that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons
market sense
mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick essentially
jotted down some notes as to what it needs and what kind a novel features we can add to differentiate our product
bbc too and bbc one or switch the channel or to turn the tv
electronics so we as the company we want to make a product trendy in fashions a big concern
watching the tv and then also made it pick up the noise and turn
personally worked with all these products i have a great deal of experience with the industrial designer
low tech and not too many buttons set appeal on to consideration
noise over certain threshold if you had a like a movie on your likely get it beeping back
listed options we hand that they require of that it's very hard
bells and whistles that we mentioned it take more budgeting more technical expenditure of effort
chance to the tft screen would break or get damaged
materials cheap but it's just the go on the dark your needs some like a charger
logo and so the slogan we put fashion in electronics
realistically then we need a product that's got some kind an ft outer casing cheap plastic
bright yellow strip forty year low skilled in the logo
nineteen euro is we've got our we've got make a profit
easier thing is just any about noise like clapping shouting
major factor to load take into consideration when i was a profit or our aims
house or say that in this a day in this part or age group from fifteen to thirty
meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles
organic shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corners
personal preferences programmable options which just requires more not a memory
cut the classes once i hit
opposed to with batteries we don't need to provide all we pride fast batteries but it's more it's that's cheaper to justify battery
update but it anyway so your hand held portable
reports in the project documents it's on your desktop
practical annotations which i a threat
