concept to see the however voice control concepts
changing how the remote control it you can send these can use remote control
controller and the fancy control and just a would be controller fancy
image on the tv and you don't need a remote control activity
meet the user requirements i'm just who's sort and then the use of the remote control market
find maybe a shape for the wooden wouldn't be wooden remote control
point is this d wanted it to be technologically innovative
voice or just recognition if you have a remote control that like have an object
speech or just to recognition and on just recognition is also worry
general fashion we want it to be in the remote control market
intelligent contra you said that we can use the voice recognition then just recognition
work on be look-and-feel design to have the easy to use board for an fancy remote control with some added value such as the simple vocal commands recognition
cost some of the impression that's all control is very attractive
Technology is the for the immediate were really need to the mexican recognition
easy to use it's not so important actually with respect
add for a lot of some function of the controller that the functional
design you comparable or without any breaks are in features
tv you can retrieve that tv we then you tv be seen that probably function
receiver to record a gestures and voice of the gesture of a power
price of adding these solar battery would it be something really that will increase the price
words all the time to show was modelling at the play-doh remote control
tune into the channel four channel three channel for some of the all the size
key it a lot of the key feature a file control and that he's it has some but that keychain
watch tv in the darkness so if you want to fine you're fine your remote control of these are lost in the dark
mobile out of you choose the line b s was recognition system will be able to instead of french
comparable to be easy to use and the fifty functions so it's a combination
fancy look-and-feel is the most important one and then if we combine
control we need something that's easy vote to remember it i reckon
present the concept of user interface would be very cute
point i haven't mentioned these people want to have a spongy touch
product is works matter percent reliable we do replace it with another man
time the same gesture as you said previously in the last meeting maybe you will get injuries
Technical as the sun interface designer speak first is to take heed jordan
user of compromise that is also the use of the tv
main point from the trend And fashion
user pay the same price you want out of four euros
income for a dv you if you have the control save ten
decisions about the components concept about the energy
work more power on the spongy way to add spongy and touch to the buttons
boat and that is the buttons and you it sounds good technically
innovative and maybe using solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add
rely my hand or percent on these features to you to use the comp
fit with the wood and design
year is that every scene from clothes shoes and furniture is easy inspired by fruits and vegetables
cd we don't have to do some basic research on this field
similar to what i've said in the previous meeting will start in thirty meeting minutes
big difference between that and it's a comparable with other products in the market
chip on print so you if you propose lot of all chips would be a and off to have something working
show use the design of what the inside at what the inside and out as a different component
sell this car for you try that is can check that handy
point is you were so we do want to have some very cheap Integrated circuits chips or do we have to lower level or very expensive
switching from one country cut corners it'd be a problem
find maybe we will close the position
specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach
war because you don't have to wear a microphone
