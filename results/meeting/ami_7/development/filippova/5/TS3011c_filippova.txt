scroll wheels because it's all curved
personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control
remote control and talking to it but it still need to points to the television
double curved then you can that's you can only use the rubber buttons you can as you scroll wheels
scroll bar the scroll wheels that's the speaker the speech recognition the rubber The fancy colours
shame they just want something colourful not specifically an apple as a remote control a yellow
watching a movie how many times you take the remote control in the in an amount of time Any wanted to switch the channel
casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved or flat case that's the most common remote can control form
images on the rubber double curved get a case you must use used by should have pushbuttons
case of the volume button and either on the side or the side but do you touch
scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button integrating the scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons
high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
energy we decided chip
colours is to back and white forearm i had a market group
cd displays there's no way you can integrated scroll bar on this side
chips we use the regular an advanced functions we can keep with a simple a chip
scroll wheel yes the voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
work with double curved single curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
customers specifically ask for the spongy feel you need to to make it buttons all of rubber
discussion the digits six on the bus and it will disappear when it's from rubber
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
feel lie if you feel your remote control you just rub on the cover so you're up on the painting
button we had in mind thing or and the last meeting the thing with the rounds
colouring is important but innovation is more important than Ease of use for the our target group
voice recognition you say i were you can program words like volume up Of newt that's a mute
yellow case and grey buttons
suggest we use the sensor sample the sample sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip
cost rating on the young group a step further dark colours simple shapes from the material
company colour something like a red of black and yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours
forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic cover with the rubber finishing
chosen the more battery with solar cell solution for the energy so which source which brings
kinetic thing it is it's possibility is more sense of it and you can store
imagine it's very goal to talk to a device with you have two points buttons in a form
watching tv when you have to make some energy used kinetic energy and all the wise
stick with the simple as straightforward and not curve design of the look and feel The user interface design
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar panel and hand dynamo
lcs ids at this is what this is my personal preference but i bet i understood that the market
space in our finance i would say do integrated
difference between a sense than direct the versions of the advanced version which is a bill
program it you musically you give and And action with which you believe it is you use a mute
devices like at telephones and are radio pocket radios
watch in a display or which channel you have chosen like that often the amount of volume
watch you watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of energy then the shaking
indicators we have the lcd displays
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
fashion watchers found out that the young target group like fruit and vegetables In their clothes shoes and furniture
forty minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
cable go back to that slide
carpets on the wall which are natural of mean friends
talk with our manufacturing department is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion questions
email is immediately start with the individual presentations the programmes
