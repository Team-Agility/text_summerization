remote control by the tv speaker and transmitter there it sends back to remote
remote control they cannot to use go they had a some basic speech recognition on it you could program

problems of the balloon was are facing the existing remote controls in the market a detailed
exist it's not very widely use i don't think easy find a with a whistle functional

chance to the tft or the lcd thing is if you're also wanting
materials cheap but it's just the go on the dark your needs some like a charger
colours and fashion were important so maybe just like little line this around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour
