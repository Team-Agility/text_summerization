hundred a new remote control is quite subjective experience
sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls
talk about the technical functions design objectives
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote control
chip which is also controlled by the user
controlling most of the working design presentation i have a pet
personally what i want from a remote control what we want to do it sends a message
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
remember that remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control hear she expects the buttons to be in certain places
lots of buttons and that might be older people maybe people specified problem right now is that people's remote
chip through the use of the user interface the user interface concept market trend were watching
technical functions presentation working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
frozen he can show me to pick up the remote all they want like an upgrade
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people
control so it's one has got lots of buttons could be yellow but we can play
brings energy or information to the chip which converts the data at the user that's controlling the chip and convert that much data
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
big buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the volume changing the channel
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
type in the page number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
older people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
breaks i was given in terms of each was the voice recognition but at the price
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
button on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or focused
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of an lcd screen was brought
shared a quite a bit rate anyone wants to work or infrared bulb which will then bring
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find specific target group were saying fifteen to thirty
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest frustration
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
receiver and in my opinion infrared
focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings adjust brightness
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv and record
putting on them in the shared folder
economic we need to find a balance between features and price as you mentioned something called rsi
coffee at the end you just only when really going on or even that those things can go out and you're happy
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
price limit of the twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
charging station like a mobile phone Or like a little cradle for your ipod
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
