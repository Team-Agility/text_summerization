Remote controls not be how do you feel
Cheap remote control where it was useful to have a kind a like power source
special button when you're talking about at this just a signal
televisions that we have the remote control hasn't got too much redundant or i needed buttons
remote control gives another signal at the one button on the remote control within five seconds
remote control because you always will pick up the remote control in remote controls and it makes stepping easy
form we should mark special remote control dunno which is forms special material
single it in the first place this is signal which it would also sent we put a separate button
docking station and probably we also have only we also need a simple chip
big deal but the remote control gets why did a state
euros then we have so maybe we have to use the advanced chip
special button for a if you push a button it sends it immediately to the television
sell the remote control without the docking station is you can only got a a problem
innovative technology for remote controls one more in our you controls not in how you finder
buttons we place them in the middle the menu button and which is the programme button
colour at the colours are special colour thing is to be marked v because that's what we were planning
imagine that would be impossible to make a docking station for two euros and thirty cents
special material also because of rubber buttons have to be rubber
open the specially them all gonna work
docking station and costs and such are not included in this list
function and that's in the one button all set to apply
simple chip but when we put in the speaker and the retriever it would be an advanced chip
push the one you can show on the telly it a one and just that there's no way it's it's it's a cat
simple chip then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents
remote control nowadays are they come with the television respond differently
double curved case a low for a remote control is at least one euro
fifty cents
buttons will be that will be matching colour for the plastic ago what colour for the rubber
battery and kinetic thing we could do to do a compromise in which you can kinetic
button you give one signal and the older televisions needs more signals to go level higher
Kinetics aren't and now they only use in watches and that's because you always working
sophisticated than on tv technology that it will give more signals It could work
display requires an advanced chip but the scroll wheel in it requires you if you vision
remote controls that down at these buttons but you still can know you can still select the twenty a number in the twenty
positive things has to be on the left so i said not oddly instead of lively
power device is very cheap that's just a regular
access that if i it's a round a lot then people find the id funny then when i move my remote control rounded
calculator also works on our own solar cells more projects than only remote controls
Fill in the number of components you guys using the five minute of the cost
points to to all of these to evaluate that design and these forget the drawing skills
question is usable it will be bought by people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries
recharger as a bit but points out we can place all on top or the buttons they can make lights
call a lot of problems The sample sensor slash sample speaker
leave it open for for there's you are because we have to reevaluate
components are listed over here the price of of the amount of button you have to put it in a carton board
display is for some numbers for some text
profit as you would twelve and a half production costs
lowest part of it so when it's the same as the other products go deeper
foley own it's site and the other side that will be a strip of rubber and in the middle
job in the first me to afford to do your first presentation to make this clear but then you have some time problems
warning finish meeting
gotta fill out a questionnaire to be honest
add a discourse now to cr to laugh
moment rome reborn
end there's an infrared led
