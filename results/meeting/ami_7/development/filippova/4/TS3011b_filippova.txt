easy to find first before you can find your remote control button you press
dec design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
luxury a remote control is just a function of remote controls and let them buttons
power buttons and use one time and the volume and the programme one and some fancy lights
ease of use remote controls the multi function and remote control but many possibilities a great feeling in touching the buttons
round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button
personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user in what state
remote going to look not any user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
channel nineteen you only have that button or change the channel or to not the volume
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to change the channel
device can have communicate with almost every tv set would have such a button because they are lost the remote
channel selection you have them to most important or volume selection and the teletext
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet is replacing teletext
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
important thing for people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control
implementing this a function the technical design or energy save design we should really implement
important button And there are lots of people do not use all the extra features
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons you have that's the cheaper the circuit board
buttons like that which are easy to use rc is the best one possibility
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
focus on younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
idea to think about these buttons trendy design lightning what and the sound from other sounds
user interface connect to chip which is connected to free things user interface
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board
list of Functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all functions available device
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition has the main it stand
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment
hebrew i bet devices which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution
chip which just a voice recognition our circuit board will become even more cheap
big advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
buy personally we should infer use infrared
production cost rr in just a part of the equipment
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness and it can be more trendy in and use design
device in a light roll it charges
money we say if we using this we can use for an average fancy lights and all that fancy
specially designs and energy friendly components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components
younger parts off the market isn't the forty percent to make the five million
thirty minutes of time to perform are individual work for ball When it's fun
products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
older you might want to constrain that portion market is to tell million units
watching a movie it would can see beep
home station for base station next a tv is a bus with nancy
dark concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
power saving will be a bit more difficult so we can expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
