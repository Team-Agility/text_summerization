jane do we tend to do a speech just for the basic options for buttons
people want something a different or more design they can go for one colour
switch form buttons which can hide in the back button and a menu button
simple buttons here and then under the screen tv you can put more advanced buttons
basic print
focus on the basic look and feel design for the for the buttons
colours you where you can make it so make the colours that let's beneath the buttons
bet it that's better keep the left and the button itself in the same colour i so just an extra
background the bright colour colours to give you an idea
menu button to flip this open and then you have two buttons to control to combination
confirmation button scroll this is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons for the menus
green apple
primary colours we can creative that that the leds on the remote control market
case that there's an menu under the menu
display we will put in here the basic functions and here where it's most reachable
appeal to the young dynamic people want soft primary colours which looks like fruits
background is very dark blue or so the contrast with the fruit of texas are pretty
flashing stand-by light up and then you can only change the colour also of the lights
buttons all buttons in red and green actually the easiest to discriminate even for colour blind
meeting we are we were putting the simple an advanced options are for the menu
aspect was twice as important as the second aspect what which was twice as important as the fruit aspect
back light
picture of doubly curved case there's the traditional uncurved flat hard case single curved
fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothing and shoes and furniture and it feels material
important thing i was think about this speech commands if the functions that are already present
easier to hold for both hands but also that you can reach the buttons
hardware inside which is so it has to have some basic shape
chip on print to be able to support the screen and have audio function
responsible enough to have a mobile phone has to work for the remote control
falls on the other side of the top side but also the side view
vds but this is the simple functions will be visible
important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel the case and the interface
single curved which means that it as curves in one dimension or the double
speech display it sounds everything that in your minutes left before the meeting
fits most in what people they wanted more more lecturers so that's not all some option
idea of it was is that because you close it you cover the lcd screen
cells but i how we would use that into the design of the actual products
technolo technological innovation we covered
standard traditional type where the forum search the function
decided kinetic provision of energy source we have four types of the basic battery
drawing that's where you have to shape for your thumb
arts materials rubber it can be done you can harm
energy source chip type case type and s user interface but i didn't see a clear distinction
discourage You two are going to work on smart board
feel weird if you would make this smaller and it's a bigger
size you can be straight if you have pop up screen in there you have to correct a t minus
call meaning so that's a dark
feels material is expected to be spongy sell the development so i will address
fashion watchers watches i have detected the trends for young public because that's our public
Track the pictures into the slide so i don't have examples
partly but you have to train on the number or the sign
factors involved in choosing the components
produce it in a china so it's no problem so my point of attention is a space be disbarred
scared about pounds get out the floor and breaking
cut the bases into the other folder
