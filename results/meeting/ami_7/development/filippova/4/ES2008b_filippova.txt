hundred a new remote control is quite subjective experience
weapons you have like you have numbers new remote control functions i will disclose
talk about the technical functions design objectives
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote control
chip which is also controlled by the user
controlling most of the working design presentation i have a pet
device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
users using a remote control hear she expects the buttons to be in certain places
lots of buttons and that might be older people maybe people specified problem right now is that people's remote
chip through the use of the user interface the user interface concept market trend were watching
technical functions presentation working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
button them i'm gonna buy a new remote all they want like an upgrade
designed to like this you have your energy source people don't wanna be changing
record the frequency that they use particular buttons and the relevant the polls buttons
brings energy or information to the chip which converts the data at the user that's controlling the chip and convert that much data
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume freeze frame
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
older people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
breaks i was given in terms of each was the voice recognition but at the price
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television and the power
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
shared a quite a bit rate anyone wants to work or infrared bulb which will then bring
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
deadline the target group that means that is very few we need to each group
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
receiver and in my opinion infrared
focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings adjust brightness
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
putting on them in the shared folder
economic we need to find a balance between features and price as you mentioned
instruction manual it comes at the end that's and hot because of the combination
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple
battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes left to define our functions
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
price limit of the twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
charging station like a mobile phone Or like a little cradle for your ipod
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
