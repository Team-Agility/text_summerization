easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
incorporated in the screen or just on the remote
Channel up and down and the control of the advanced options and functions and buttons is easy
menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
easy so for just a zapping around channels you can just push one button
screen is all the configuration options you can put that on the screen functions
zapping which are a remote control you can press the menu button and then you are certainly into the the display
button access the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu
functional aspects of the remote in my department
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional requirements
feel of the left example and then the screen is on top which function
normal functions and these basic functions you normally press
time you have one button is also like a to confirm a action
reach a little bit for the power button and channel volume selection are teletext
press said you the screen gets activated and then you can use this buttons to press
problem with the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen is below and the buttons are in the middle
people use mobile phones and also have a screen on top
channels and left or right for the volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program the channels
indy it's the remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
tvs in standby people just press the channel frequency or your tv and so your remote
plug in the power cable when you go back it's only two extra buttons
problem mean you are you a car and channel volume selection present the numbers present
department do we need just the functional display and for curses
younger users are more acquainted with these machines so they can use more advanced functions
channel five on channel five and phone account channel anything you want to move the only kind to channel
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design of the remote
larger public we have more options are activated based on some so for options
save this and you just press the number in a remote and then say a confirm and then it's a it's easier
idea because then it becomes clear about the extra two buttons or active
remote like this if you put it on the top and then make the corporate logo
match the operating behaviour of the users are not afraid of a lot of functions

tv options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble i'm base
irrelevant the less use for audio settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour
screen this you been option to go back to it to upper level the finally
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
elderly people don't understand it so so they need a simpler remote
simple and all that advanced features are hidden in the screen with the clear menu
microphone it can be very small phones are just are some stripes a little holes
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
news flash and teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
communication if the television it's difficult but that's not hard part you don't have to design
product should reach a new market which is the customers below forty
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
state of the save automatically display the name which you get to the cable
skip this price as because i read a ball forty is it from twenty to forty
work for thirty minutes
