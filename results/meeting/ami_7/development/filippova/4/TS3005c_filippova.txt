pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
important thing people like to last year was that the remote the speech control
decision on the remote control concepts
easier to do in colour than a shape
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
remote control has no way or in the settings menu for button channel volume
japanese people the rubber small hands
small because you have how much nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the lcd screen
main you can fit the lcd screen as large as the remote control itself yelling
hand there and then you want touch the screen
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly people
button you are pressing the right moment
young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
important position the people can see it because it is the unique
wood rubber rubber that makes it easy to to tune that's it's of colour
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
buy Not faster when they look the same old grey or black the colours
screen they don't need that big so it's it's really an important function of the remote
buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
larger it's not really on scale then to work an option for mount station
option to use as a in a rather simple lcd screen
shapes it is something between the square shape sit around got on the round
options is the settings of the remote enough to tv and that a thing called cults settings
young people they liked fruity colours like reading brown light out dark red yellow
hard part of this or softer rubber is the best suits poll up material
tie That what you'd like to do on the screen is want to go back
elderly people like a plain normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
touchscreen makes it possible to get to go nation of your finger on screen the case
easy to have it something like but and minus here the sofa here Minus
printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal print
noticed that be in this file design or the user interface and the buttons
change a scroll with the menu to look up some some channels on your television
chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium
point we already decided that on the previous meeting placed inside our project folder
chip on print think cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
conceptual design meeting which is you were opened
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
find something in the middle ground that square and round corners put a little in the middle
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
sense that it you ask you give a question mark how much we spy thing with energy
time we have forty minutes or thirty minutes of forty minutes of use Nx
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
bigger for microphone for the speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
recharge through docking station
record into the device into the speaker
schools it is in the actual design
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
edit issue to remove degrees
agenda the base five presentation is once again or at least an agenda
