find it and it when you just press one button and it doesn't work
options
remote control eight percent use would spend more money when a remote control for kids
shopping is cr or a tv control especially when you only have tv function
reading on a page remote control just sends come on space six months to to television
points we had last meeting was should be you universal tv controller you need that one button that has to stripes
remote control becomes a green a red button to go to the next one or two ago could prove
people so they're all and not younger people what they use what they want on remote control
pressed or like you press the one that circuit chip knows what button you pressed
teletext option Maybe we have to skip
user to remember if i press that button it goes to that channel
missed did i miss any other buttons those buttons
special all the plo eight people use standard buttons
normal be put in the simple buttons on the top
small light around the button you push so you see green lights flashing
stripes so you have like at five seconds period to press those two buttons
point is if we made make remote control for only television it's hard to sell it for twenty five euros
simple is to use to send the standards So standardise the methods like a know remote controls
divide between functions you often used like maybe switch channels and volume and that things and the menu button
computer it's on your television dvd players t real and vcr had a question
problem to because you have to be fast enough maybe the elderly people no rights
find out what people use maybe just use questionnaires on the internet
full like your it's already said only ten percent on the top ten year
numbers only numbers for the more nothing but only the numbers want to twenty
banana what are the most things in modern tvs are also on the menu
older people are more critical where they spend their money
buttons the design is most important you can do integrate that volume and previous
teletext is become outdated since the popularity of internet and elderly people often use teletext
screen green
hard to realise that we have short time to put it on the market
functions i could think of volume channels the basic a call that number but This one two three cetera the text there's options basic on off and find
lights emitting diode is producing infrared light this invisible
work them and does it have to work only in english or in dutch
hard to remember what channel connects to what favourite it what channel
invisible and this one's producing normal one also a normal light not led light
fits at the what time if you set about the older people older
main people of interest of this company was about of forty plus people or torture
optional like we discussed like ipod different colours
recognition about you said one and the television turns
configuring the spectrum just chip is trying to switch off the television
room so we have to understand what buttons are used to to make it universal
fallen off to take the efforts to design something with the speech recognition directly
chip for is producing the pattern Like a morse code
required because it like in a mobile phone in the dark
sixty five persons the city of persons of the users said they zap
main thing is the usability that's when we can make it a special product
product should reach a new market this custom and our do you wanna forty so it should be flashy
Red so it shows that like something's
circuit as close to produce is the pattern
method i used is search the web just web page provided
colours you can choose blue or yellow
wall new product or own style be we this is so difficult a difficulty
