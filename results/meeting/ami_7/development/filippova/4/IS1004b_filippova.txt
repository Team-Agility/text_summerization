ready Betty often because they lost the remote comes in the remote control the remote
list people are what it about the shape of the remote control
remote control Being one or beyond thing and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition
people are they are more interested they incorporating new technologies in the remote control
remote controls are used by more than one person's And as you targeting single people
simple a task in that we're only doing a television remote in that as a replacement remote control
people go through by as a remote control when they broke brought to hold
remote control but i have new you we inputs for about that the peaks
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
simplest thing the remote control does is it just change that change the channel
wise limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition technology does mean sitting there on that Remote
point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty five you're price
meeting about the functional design
application and then shape of the buttons is important but also it the number of buttons
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press a button
users as our marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition
add deviated is a tv or we have control of the tv then we can actually display
pretty wide range of remote control shouldn't be very they have looked pretty hard
young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
People so complain because they all have the same size of the voters four buttons which are not betty
priced a remote control it would really be worth us on that would be worth implementing
time corporate to do with the remote control you start and then you stop
background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition to adjust and that can fit
work it does work was supposed to work on and so on the working
point to To find out can we increases the price part of this right control
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen just for changing channel
cd screen except for the really main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared of lcd and speech record
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
programmes on off and you what channels already what's on If you have a list
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
working design is so user interface could be of two things one is the usual
target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but there are a fancy intends to intends to had to have rarely
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons
extra internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should feed the hand shape
functional requirements and especially for the For the user requirements you need that internet
famous speech technology switch at existing so deeply the book would be which is the easiest
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
la is that the court is sitting similarly there are different interfaces
speak buttons out of something which is really everybody's ready in good morning
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
bring testing sings i have seen them on the one that's got a welcome pick it or is this we'll that we can use to navigate
hope that next meeting we do that we take some decisions that they record sex
master a very easy is assigned they could be sold in inside the court
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
scd e still on this get used to open about this cd
optional extra did gonna make our product since we say we put in the fashion in electronics
cda same movement which is not with our not very up repeat device You'll do we have problems
names that we could decide fall just to get something fun for our project we should we could discuss quickly Any ideas
message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting the green one and it can watch
english it sounds like them and school you know men
imagine also that's the microphone it would be an ambiance and that and then it's microphones
naming we see fault for the look-and-feel later so let's go for this representation
