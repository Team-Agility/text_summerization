keeping a very small and simple set of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
cost we should just go for push buttons which is what real reaction
press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
depending them a week at a buttons remain things but then i go back
onscreen menu of your channel traces then you can scroll down on the scrolling
main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as or the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control
important features for a remote is seen a menu button so that we can access
people they blinked on the important aspects of a remote control get a certain amount of a light
thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll an actual i got ipods scroll button
buttons to select your favourite channels and the channel flipping and then the other white
time when you're watching tv in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons
access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
simple a regular one or an advanced chip we can have a simple chip depending
sit there and stand control the television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
ri uses for buttons to me to move around so range of settings so on a small lcd screen
intrigued by the idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
money into the like the kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches
concept of the user interface we have to decide on whether i have a scroll
bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main
advantages and disadvantages if you have an lcd display would have to be quite small
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
essentially we need to choose how is this device this is an ipod from apple
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case it can have any titanium
screen there are on the actual tv if you're changing the brightness tuning the tv
ideas had it possibly use these and how to use a fruit and vegetable colours
switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
examine each element separately but we're designing
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
find a way to protect like the chip
double curved like would that be like two hands time i am imagining
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on how should report are produced
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
fickle a or latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
conceptual design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
stressing more talking we then talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
presentation i have one more slide before we close but in that side we thought of it a little text
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
plastic but we have all these fashion and simplicity so if we're going for fashion
list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
designer of our real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options that we have for manufacturing
envisioning more like the material like you have when you said megabytes of also it doesn't hurt
saved it this in the shared project
