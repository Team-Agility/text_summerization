fruit bat that in that aspect of a of the remote control to be the shape of a banana
button but going to know every design should have at a button if you press
bring to the remote control so i was all the idea that we can have to power supply
user's gonna buy a banana remote
include rf structure in the remote you do need my income for a remote control
findings is uses would be really interested in a look at the doing to find that the shape of a fruit which is handy
scroll button but push technology for channel selection volume control and they need exposing these are the three scroll buttons on the banana
fruit thing with the banana if you could have the colour of a banana
easier to do a banana and plastic
starting is good but you could you should have more the shape of banana if you want to point
base station even if it's just you press that button on that and and the remote control starts beeping this is a way of finding the remote
unaware at this point of the fruit for kids
design and you have to work on the user should it should be already p define
difficult to make it steve like the texture of an hour anyway and take to have exact shape
cost a lot just feel five watch
concentrating on like a fruit design the number eight maybe we wanna so what collection of fruit logo
design for a coffee machine that that with producing is you can say good morning
people would find out what's it even if it wasn't a recharging station even if they didn't have to buy batteries
bite the things that by nine that and the base station extra on the side
scroll past television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations
decided not to go for speech recognition technology that we can add keywords speech
wall or a sporting keywords but everybody's and saying it's volume because it's the volume
received an email i'll and lunchtime they know that the bring in mind to the technology division has developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker
switch way you could that you could turn out from attacking the top of the banana
meeting we should take a decision on that point it has to a circuit board
mice for some people more functional and then carmine but if they have these scroll-wheels
rising is a factor for us that so we'll go for the regular chip in banana
genetically engineered for it is designed to be square so they'd attack start it in the boxes
fits in the hand and you had a lot of so phase two The for the controls
extra for the functionality is such as the wheels the speaker you need so that in on the list but the device
beep or people are more the devastating never find a fancy look and feel
technology lcd has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out so it's the basic
feel so old now More more core aspect not more hard core that aspect rather than a devise ways to many phones times on many buttons
opinion we should for goes on young people might get annoying if we if we just dump
pushbuttons the traditional uses we can have the pushbuttons so that they don't feel
recognise it can be like a match on on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back
united some you could have a little red light that comes up and i press that so they feeling it's really going fast
template every channel four hundred channels you have to be a tool to recognise
idea of a banana but without looking completely Teach works we go for the range
cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production components
additional it will be might be having slightly better market
break so you'd have to worry too much about the case been broken is the inside
real recognise i he was but he was in a set not like a freight you train
cells and the lighting conditions are good that can be useful it'd be pretty in a week
reading we have to close the meeting a few minutes of the last meetings
city's would not be possible to implement it for the next prototype is but actually integrated
draw some sketch about so which would be the pro the final product and that were strip
shape if you'd and not be out the door probably you may as do it in a style as way that just looks a bit more twenty five euro
ripple it's all the ideas we've had we had doing these presentations we had that's sold
plastic you can have the book but the side not the materials like wood
double curve would actually menu and you could like drawer something on on the whiteboard
feature a rough loads for the tools
microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big
fascinates It's freed and they this thing is free time
ctv you need internet connection
