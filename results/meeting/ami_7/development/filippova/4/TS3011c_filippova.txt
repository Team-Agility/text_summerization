scroll wheels because it's all curved
personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control
remote control and talking to it but it still need to points to the television
double curved then you can that's you can only use the rubber buttons you can as you scroll wheels
scroll scroll wheels that's the speaker the speech recognition the rubber The fancy colours
