remote control but it seems that's so important but it's used as a remote controls going to the smart
remote control we should be easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone
device on that can be used for speech recognition and it's cheap or a remote control
people dollars for which the remote control is Is to be something useful that i'm going to talk
simple button and speech recognition technology
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
market of remote controls they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention
heard that it seems that speech recognition or a beer cans with speech recognition
converse to having you see the button i the weirdest maybe one of these buttons
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
marriage are all The Brawl the way of saying the thing if we look back
expensive since we want to port some other features that speech recognition you want the radios
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and batteries
colours of like fruits and vegetables and spongy
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology inside
chip do we have only the plastic or that cd five or a chip
integrate some into our remote control something like a light
define or a speech recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology
colours they can be more money too bad These And the shapes and then they can have different assembly
people use need to the trains if we were in the world as our company
tomatoes and It's that easy they're rubber is expensive
concept not only for the interface we used and if there is some supplements
flat different colours Depending on what is around like what colours around and depending on the temperature
mark the user interface design
ready in the post and down to locate then we have to go for some speaker
follow smart should be some not too complicated
hate those specific features or they really like They're more want these fancy features
sixty then you make a lot of money are you don't and you're out of business
chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive they feel is colour lcd
titanium smelling like fruit or do we make spongy on one that animal A chip
interestingly this is the very most important one is that it has to be fancy
propose but the use of solar cells hand too late to just use simple battery
end we find out that it's not feasible in terms of sponginess
story that for the point before why not the rubber aspect might be important
bone shape it has to be more wrong than the More roo look natural
record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
plastic we stick last time
friends you can travel from golf to furniture so it might be fruit and vegetable
fruit these teams can be easily incorporate
recogniser but we want to goals speaker independent or speaker dependent
interface there to use pushbuttons or you could just read it cd display lcd
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
phone we can use the phone as a good to Example of work to it beeps back
dark blue who are watching the trends there inventing it You're creating the trend i hope
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
meeting are on the them first and component concept so what energy and the media and the interface for energy
feel most warlike we can test
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning
red goes faster than the life
work together a menu on a prototype using modelling clay
body one call really come up with our forties
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that mark and then sandy
puts lots of concentrate
