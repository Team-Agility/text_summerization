easy to find your remote control
dec design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
remote controls and let them buttons
power buttons and use one time and the volume
ease of use remote controls the multi function
round buttons should be the truth
personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user
remote going to look not any user interface designer
buttons connected to the sender which generates
channel nineteen you only have that button
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to change the channel
device can have communicate with almost every tv set
channel selection is the most important
teletext buttons are not in our design
thumb Determine the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
important thing what a remote control reports
decided to implement seemingly easy design
people do not use all the extra features
advantage is that the circuit board
easy to use we my coat rack
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
focus on younger people because it's easy
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
buttons trendy design lightning what and the sound
connected to free things user interface
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost circuit board
list of Functions then they mikes
draw the ten percent the buttons
drop the voice recognition the data
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment
devices which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
market is interested in some advanced new techniques
sebastian will find the one solution
cheap to incorporate integrated circuit the chip
big advantage is that we can implement
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
hope personal coach is we'll assist
production cost rr in just a part of the equipment
light for that when you move the stick
find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness
device in a light roll it charges
generates messages using infrared light diodes
important point is that we really should use energy friendly components
part is forty percent of the market
time to perform are individual work
products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
market is to tell million units
watching a movie it would can see beep
base station next to see this a little antenna
discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
minutes made the project documents folder
opened the cd rom box accidentally
case we have to metal contacts
