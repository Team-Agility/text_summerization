lots of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
cost we should just go for push buttons
hand and you press the buttons are fun
buttons remain things but then i go back
onscreen menu of your channel traces then you can scroll
main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as or the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control
menu display that comes up on the television
people they blinked on the important aspects of a remote control
ipods and things right now have touch scroll buttons
buttons changing the volume favourite channels is applicable
people when i watch tv in the dark
access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip depending
sit there and stand control the television from your armchair
idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen
information i have no idea of the scroll wheel
solar battery although there are slight complications with solar battery
kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches
concept of the user interface and we'll come back to the chip
case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
advantages and disadvantages if you have an lcd display
shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
essentially we need to choose how is this device
double curved case it can have any titanium
tv if you're changing the brightness on trying to see it happening
buttons could be shaped like a vegetable colours
switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
start something that or show you some examples
examine each element separately but we're designing
spongy latex it's a spongy is the end
determine what the essential functions of the device
care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end
find a way to protect like the chip
double curved like would that be like two hands time
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on how should report are produced
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
fickle a or latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
conceptual design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
minute or if you the minutes left of the meeting
stressing more talking we then talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
presentation i have one more slide before we close but in that side
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
work together on a prototype using modelling clay
opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
plastic but we have all these fashion and simplicity so if we're going for fashion
list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
research has been carried out by real reaction company wind focus on fashion
simple regular advanced chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
envisioning more like the material like you have when you said megabytes of also it doesn't hurt
saved it this in the shared project
