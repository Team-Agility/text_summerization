pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
notice there's used you have a remote control
decision on the remote control concepts
easier to do in colour than a shape
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
menu or just you just wanted to know the volume
japanese people the rubber small hands
button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons
work with the lcd screen was a rather small
hand there and then you want touch the screen
called like what's the trends from past years
button you are pressing the right moment
meets more the young people than older people
people can see it because it is the unique
rubber rubber is still the rubber isn't fancy
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
colours it was the slogan and the corporate colour
screen they don't need that big of cpu
buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
larger it's not really on scale then to work an option
option to use as a in a rather simple chip
square shape sit around got on the round
called cults settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu
young people they liked fruity colours like red yellow
hard part of this or softer rubber should be soft
remembered and menu to go back from the floor
people like a plain normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
touchscreen makes it possible to get to go nation of your finger on screen the case
easy way to a program that you say record
printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal print
user interface are also some questions about the concepts you have some ideas
change a scroll with the menu to look up some some channels on your television
chip and we have that's it's possible to scratchy
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium
point we already decided that on the previous meeting
cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
conceptual design meeting which is you were opened
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
square and round corners put a little in the middle
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
question mark how much we spy thing with energy
lasting not not be anti it's a two minutes
slow you can make a versus the microphone
ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
question and three seconds later you say the answer
recharge through docking station
record into the device into the speaker
schools it is in the actual design
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
edit issue to remove degrees
prepared a little presentation will we on your side
