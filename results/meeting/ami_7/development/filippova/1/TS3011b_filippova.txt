easy to find your remote control button you press
dec design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
luxury a remote controls and let them buttons
power buttons and use one time and the volume
ease of use remote controls the multi function
round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions
personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user
remote going to look not any user interface designer
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected
channel nineteen you only have that button or change the channel switching
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to change the channel
device can have communicate with almost every tv set
channel selection you have them to most important
combination but teletext buttons are not in our design
thumb Determine the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
main important thing what a remote control reports
multi function the technical design or energy save design we should really implement
people do not use all the extra features
fewer buttons you have that's the cheaper the circuit board
easy to use rc is the best one possibility
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
focus on younger people than less than forty years
starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
buttons trendy design lightning what and the sound
user interface connect to chip which is connected
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost circuit board
include other in a stiff Functions then they mikes
draw the ten digits but keep the program
drop the voice recognition has the main it stand
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment
devices which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
market is interested in some advanced new techniques
sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution
chip which just a voice recognition our circuit board will become even more cheap
big advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept
buy personally we should infer use infrared
production cost rr in just a part of the equipment
light for that when you move the stick
find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness
device in a light roll it charges
fancy lighting and techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
important point is that we really should use energy friendly components
sell about to forty percent of the market
thirty minutes of time to perform are individual work
products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
older you might want to constrain that portion market
watching a movie it would can see beep
base station next to see this a little antenna
discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
slight problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
