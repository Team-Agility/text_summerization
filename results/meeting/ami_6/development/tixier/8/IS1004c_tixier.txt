speaker from the outside of the banana that advanced chip
worth but it doesn't really add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech recognition engines
cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production components
design and you have to work on the user interface
plastic with some elasticity so that if you're of the remote control what's the sample sensor sample speaker
people would find out what's it even if it wasn't a recharging station even if they didn't have to buy batteries

banana you can you hold it like this and have the scroll wheel on top
scroll past television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations

decided not to go for speech recognition technology just because of some reasons and all honesty
fits in the hand and you had a lot of so phase two The for the controls
beep or people are more the devastating never find a fancy look and feel down in the technology gonna be know in innovation
hot out of a device that may be difficult to can have to build
