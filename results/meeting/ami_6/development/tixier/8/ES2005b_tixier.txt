people most of teams and people they find that the remote control
functions of the users in their remote controls we should emphasise but actually can do more hard for the operate better than making it too complicated
kinda feels a bit different from a lot of remote control
Seventy five percent of the country where they find too difficult to operate a remote control
find it that was more like in a few watching a fill in the dark you can still see the remote control
speak something of the remote control it applies to something and it glows in the dark about this sectors
user interface for this to be just a bunch of buttons
consumers they're willing to have pay more for speech recognition and whistling
remote control know what's been produced by the television which i'm presuming
concerned way of What effect be a greater should have on the user interface it should be trendy
care of this vector also like our design should be appropriate should be good looking for the consumers
built since the tv and then also made it pick up the noise and turn
mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people like glow in the dark
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television
problems of the balloon was are facing the existing remote controls in the market survey on consumers was bound to find
user can put in their favourite channels and maybe they prefer to find settings that wanna turn on and start blasting
market ancient art of how we should design can do other remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros
read any research and how many people other people would require
safety point of view also we have pretty clear
exist it's not very widely use i don't think easy find a with a whistle functional
told us that Consumers are willing to spend more for fancy product
work for a while though because of this noise problem they mentioned
press the pick want to get on to the big
flat screen interface to it you only need to find
telephone that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons
jotted down some notes as to what it needs and what kind a novel features we can add to differentiate our product
miss out on the button and if you hit that menu the top
work with all these products i have a great deal of experience with the industrial designer
electronics so we as the company we want to make a product trendy in fashions a big concern
durable and that can also be economic and it kinda
low tech and not too many buttons set appeal on to consideration
cheaper than tft it's just a microphone and some integrated circuits
materials cheap but it's just the go on the dark your needs some like a charger
colours and colour options they want corporate colour and slogan some higher implemented the new design
bells and whistles we gotta come up with a gimmick but not too complicated
fashion were important so maybe just like little line this around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour
encoding i'm getting from little bits of what channel and being sent is that they're quite interested in tft display interactive display
integrating the rabbit integrate the logo on as bright yellow
nineteen euro is we've got our we've got make a profit
house or say that in this a day in this part or age group from fifteen to thirty
shout your command to it do it for you if it's within what i'm hearing range
major factor to load take into consideration when i was a profit sense
update but it anyway so your hand that they require of that it's very hard
realistically then we need a product that's got some kind an ft outer casing cheap plastic
decided in the last meeting that i have to find
organic shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corner
definite requirements that they will that we need to scroll
opposed to with batteries we don't need to provide all we pride fast batteries but it's more it's that's cheaper to justify battery
reports in the project documents it's on your desktop
practical annotations which i a threat
