Remote controls not be how do you feel
Cheap remote control where it was useful to have a kind a like power source
televisions that we have the remote control supplied as you can do the buttons with a one and a dash into a dash but when you use but the remote control hasn't got too much redundant or i needed buttons
mb and a lot of remote control gives a signal to see that then they send it signal
logo is It's It's pretty all the used to see on the remote control and it makes stepping easy
single it in the first place this is signal which it would also sent we put a separate button when you're talking about at this just a signal
year is in the docking station would be a fifth of the price of the remote control
deem them must be innovative technology for remote controls one more in our you controls not in how you finder
push a button then all your television there will be one and align it which is it and displaced
colour at the colours are special colour thing is to be marked v because that's what we were planning
problem now is that the There's no such thing as a docking station and pretty players
form we should mark special remote control dunno which is forms special material
imagine that would be impossible to make a docking station for two euros and thirty cents
amount of button and which is the programme button for the scart audio video external input
open the specially them all gonna work
part no appeals to me call thinking of our design philosophy with the rubber and in the middle
chip and with the retriever a device it will costa a bit more like a high in the advanced chip
Schematic few of the remote control what nothing about the advanced chip but the scroll wheel in it requires you if you vision
technology that it will give more signals It could work
docking station anyway because we have some cost and such are not included in this list
big deal but the remote control gets why did a state
's technical function tv functionality of that's a separate button when you wanna find
fifty cents a button
remote control nowadays are they come with the television needs more signal to go level higher
double curved case a low for a remote control is at least one euro
Twelve euros and fifty cents
watch it's a kinetic thing we could do to do a compromise in which you can kinetic
colour as the rubber on the side
remote controls that down at these buttons but you still can know you can still select the twenty a number in the twenty times an hour
positive things has to be on the left so i said not oddly instead of lively
rubber parts and it's the readiness of thing and then when you move the round of my notes
cable with a buttons on it We do retrieval a device
power device is very cheap that's just a regular
calculator also works on our own solar cells more projects than only remote controls
possibility to do so because it would wouldn't fit are the final design According to a few points
middle there's hard to hard material have a hard plastic with a light on the top or the buttons they can make lights
score higher on innovative technology some is this if it was impossible
excel in on the in the range in the field of design and the looks and feel
job in the first me to afford to do your first presentation to make this clear but then you have some time problems
targets a group of people said gregory and for all with their remote control has never speaking
rechargeable thing was something to those are you people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries
lowest part of it so when it's the same as the other products go deeper
eighty percent of the price of of the amount of components of truth specific point
leave the retrieve in such a side will give it a more less ugly or side
ten eleven twelve and thirteen
display is for some number of components you guys using the five minute of the cost
important part of these meeting
gotta fit into the shape
add a discourse now to cr to laugh
tend to hear a bell
