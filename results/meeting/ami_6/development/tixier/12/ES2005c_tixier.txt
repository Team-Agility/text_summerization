bare essentials that we need to have a remote control
identified as a fruit and natural
remote control switch look and feel a vote
people want like if somebody wanted in banana shaped we will put that case we want to that war waveform
easy to like at the different shape of button
include either with the rid of it some remotes and we give something new technology got are the ones where and as as new design the outlook of the remote controls
engineered so we ended up make it different difficult shape
survey findings was that they want to easy to use a i'm not about the lcd
shape i quite like the design
marketing to thirty five to thirty five so most people
idea because people use mile mice mouse is now with the scrolling
technologically innovative like glow in the dark or speech recognition
fashion their shows that fruit and veggie there was a people
vector it is twice as important factor
opposite what does it make the on the upper side
interface the buttons and you point to it rather than having the output is a stream of text
specifically as voice activated
comfortable to hold it if it's gonna be voice recognition
buttons do we want to just have a device that maybe sets and pretend it's a fruit
speech recognition software that you can programme
beep or a dave and feel of the material is expected to be spongy the other than just having a plastic look a hard
narrowed it down to half a dozen options
oval double curved send it to me if we're talking about three or can we can easy
chip we need to buy input from the buttons
durable and easy to understand in the local language
black and white i it just doesn't like funky
options from wood or titanium rubber plastic with a latex
scroll it and then when you reach the a menu item that you require you pressed the middle of a scroll
colours so and all in yellow tend to go to together crs main

meeting i'm going to discuss what the trend watching
sends out the infrared light signal to the television watchers
playing could be green or on and off as reds
open up there's a circuit board we have to use bc at the same setup processor
charge friends this as good as you pointed
twenty five thirty five euros a cat or twelve years fifteen manufacturing
rl the data but it is good for have ten which is quite this for the one that we can begin
sit on a say in that and It's quite got a quite a steady pace
price and price not withstanding is it too complicated it's it can be too much just overloaded
project documents is on the Test
promote any size we like or is there a minimum
pushing it probably bit funny fruitshaped
