pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour
material should we used to to make one of those from remote control
decided to have to remotes to the size
table what lcd screen as large as the remote control itself yelling
button when you get a lcd screen
hand there and then you want touch the screen
break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses
called like what's the trends from past years what colour shapes colours Material and elderly people
meets more the young people than older people
rubber the total piece of rubber
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to press the button
easier to do in colour physical forward
scroll cs or if you have a lot of options
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
idea of making it And one single curved
big difference between young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
square shape sit around got on the round
discussed in the earlier that's all of people don't really want to use these extra settings
fruity colours Innovative all the colleges you blue red and brown
easy it's quite a simple lcd screen
round shapes As soft with the material like the rubber
sound and the channel buttons won't get that small when a cds green
touchscreen makes it possible to get to go nation of your finger on screen the case
menu or just you just wanted to know the volume
remembered and menu to go back
elderly people just plain old because we decided
graphical user interface there are going to work together on for a foundering a smartboard
recharge through docking station so that's charges
navigate through menu great with the scroll
colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
easy way to a program that you say record into the device into the speaker
chip and we have that's it's possible to scratchy
chargeable with an option for mount station
explain some properties of the material
rubber which you can look and feel weird
switch it just from the previous meeting
miss possible to the g you just put in a row underneath it on the bottom of the remote
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
schools it is in the actual design
square and round corners put a little in the middle
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
charges itself lot instead of plan yalina something like that questions
ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition
lose the pen if you lose the pen
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
meeting is once again in thirty minutes
today i elaborate on the concept
prepared a little presentation is once again or at least an agenda
lay flat down on table
