click i was thinking it's left and design right-handers in the family want to have two remotes
Imagine it did it with your left hand
find ideas for ideal remote
mobile to the size of your hand
fit the criteria And the criteria
marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes got on the market
compatible with the left and right hand side
funny all design the meetings could be this quick
amount buttons people like a lot let black
simple and easy to use double
feel so it does remote look and feel fashionable
build rocket ships we can handle that can do that right that remotes
designer there are some heated discussion
lie and the table left-handed people
small and then they say it's something that's new looks a bit kirk if people
ergonomic and to be made out of rubber very simple and easy
main criteria from the last meeting you had to teach you proof
manager of this is that after the after this fat of fruit and vegetable
lost is easy to get lost
simple but the fact that we use the kinetic energy
hold it like that the one on your thumb the thumb button is the power button
banana them as a mute button
pens and writing on these special pads
meeting finished but officially then we'll get a questionnaire to fill
vested interest in there Profit profit sharing
saved on the production cost do we know how much we were making a profit
special form they're special form they're in shapes
numeric keypad on top so you can keep directly to the channel
Hold on folks We fit
black yellow and blue
email side percent
Index finger is channel up know fingers channel down ring fingers
project manager The the price for everybody here i haven't worked on it both individually
case we've gone for the double curved
everyone's come up with our individual ideas in there and different apartments
wind up and vibrating pen
time with the tv you can start
speech read that will come up on the computer screen is a picture file rather than actual text
cost ten euros seventy cents
handwriting recognition but it's not a speech
read any of the ornaments and break
wee which we had it As far as our financial goals we have a specific number for profits that we wanted us fifty
sense because i remember like You better off my mom over there i remember people's mom's making like a play doh where you just like make the you use colouring
envy of all the whole wall there are teams
basic functionality is as far as what keys
important cues are ready you if you're right it convenient place for you to access
wrap it up and have five minutes of Sounds
colourwise and is it spongy so what mark
slip like between couch cushion
Lisa marie you just apply
