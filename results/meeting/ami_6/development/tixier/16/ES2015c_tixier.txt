raised up buttons So you can feel
links into the different depends on what type of buttons or just the push button
research into the different components that we could use what's available to us to actually make the remote control
cost of buttons what functions will show
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control
phone that i was thinking of as when you change in the face it's generated
depending on what kinds of the design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
actual remote would be hard plastic and put it in rubber can get on top
user friendly remote control that a lot of interface consist of a quarter of buttons
decided that the command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television that people have in the kitchen
solar power not maybe not working this have to shake it a bit and revitalise
wimp should see what the success of the first Face plates are busily to keep in mind
graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point
explain what the user interface to make it more trendy and we still have the money
kinetic thing was stressed about lies it's instant energy is transformed into a power to make a circuit
buttons so one same colour it's face could have its own colour of button
lots of different possibilities for the energy you don't need an x then also the battery supply all solar panels
symbol of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power
casing and the rubber would just be that what's in contact with the human eye
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
silly if we do point to have anything else just have to not important
strip it down to like really basic shape
important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be technologically innovative
reconvene in thirty minutes to finish our meeting we talked about our favourite animals
meet so it's a medium or regular chip was supposed to simple
separate apart from the chip which will probably decide whether we buy a simple regular advanced
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual components so we'd have to get it in separately
difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at ed
pointing device that doesn't include good like ten to earlier there are these different options
photos of fruit and vegetable things if that's going to work for us sound
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
brings it thing we need to be recharged and the bulk the size
advanced would have to go with a lcd c Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
diodes transistors resonators resistors and passes it could pass it is all need to be considered
lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentation
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
amount of time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
looked at the design report from previous years here real remote
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
dynamo which is the thing that was used to which is fifty years ago the ousted
audio settings mono stereo pitch
information We need to start making some more specific decisions
