infrared remote control and talking to it but it still need to points to the television
hold a remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb So in that case
cd displays there's no way you can integrated with buttons you can as you scroll wheels
watching a movie how many times you take the remote control in the in an amount of time Any wanted to switch the channel
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
Yellow case and grey buttons
note if you want to use these rubber of the case you must use used by should have pushbuttons
casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved or flat case that's the most common remote can control form
case of the volume button and either on the side or the side but do you touch
flawless Think about a scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons
compare the little bit with the big ray image you have in your presentation the big remote control
extra high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular
colours is to back and white forearm i had a market group likes a more colourful
advanced a shape which is curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
customers specifically ask for the spongy feel you need to to make it buttons all of rubber
discussion the digits six on the bus and it will disappear when it's from rubber
scroll wheel yes the voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
colouring is important and soft material but we're since we're cost reading room The younger group
finishing this is what's on the edge what you feel your remote control you just rub on the cover so you're up on the painting
button we had in mind thing or and the last meeting the thing with the rounds
banana a telephone telephone from siemens the yellow rubber telephone use it for volume
cell phones which exchangeable cover with the rubber finishing
issue i addressed at the Point i would like to some issues that would like to point
suggest we use the sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip i fault
stick with the simple as straightforward and not curve design and it's too dull
fruit and vegetables are important but innovation is more important than Ease of use for the our target group
yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours are great and yellow
latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cell solution for the energy
kinetic thing it is it's possibility is more sense of it and you can store
tv when you have to make some energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it's against the wall
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar panel and hand dynamo
lcs ids at this is what this is my personal preference but i bet i understood that the market
talk about all the different components wire in this design of the look and find an internet
space in our finance i would say do integrate some functions
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
version of the advanced a version of the chip supports lcd that's all and we've decided
program it you musically you give and And action with which you believe it is you use a mute
watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of energy then the shaking
indicators we have the lcd displays
walls the reef like the infrared light
imagine it's very goal to talk to a device with you have two points to another device
cost rating on the young group like fruit and vegetables In their clothes shoes and furniture
back in thirty minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
talk with our manufacturing division is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion questions
afraid is not possible to print a picture or the size
hit home is the pm
