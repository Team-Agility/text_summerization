buttons connected the buttons
dec design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find the remote control
unique feature of a remote control so we might want to build in the future to support them Some audio signal like one phones
power buttons and use one time and the volume
method of the remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
press it and your tv set starts to make a weights out and your remote control
user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control Because the user
imagine when you only have a set like to go there and you have about six on the channel switching
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to change the channel
remotes are reports it we give back to the user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
control the tv set would have such a device you would have to walk you tv
easier way of a round button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
stick for volume control and channel selection you have them to most important function In one button
buttons for the advanced other Functions do you want an explicit list which include all function available device
important button And there are lots of people do not always want to use the voice
decided to implement this a function and can be implemented in in our design will become more complicated
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip set a circuit boards
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the cost and all that things maybe sebastian
buttons like that which are easy to use rc is the best one possibility
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
cheaper that the chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger people than less than forty years
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume and the programme one and some fancy lights
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound from other sounds
market is interested in some advanced new techniques and the user friendliness
cell phone just one like in the device which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten minutes left this meeting
buy personally we should infer use infrared
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components
main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
generates a few times within that a certain period of time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
younger part off the market isn't the forty percent to make the five million
older you might want to constrain that portion market would respond to a simple
watching a movie it would can see beep
home station for base station next a tv is a bus with nancy
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
summary of all things are spoken and the different concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
disadvantages that there are so concerns about the costs and things like that battery life to the batteries
user-friendly as you feel fifties
seconds i received some new project documents folder
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
