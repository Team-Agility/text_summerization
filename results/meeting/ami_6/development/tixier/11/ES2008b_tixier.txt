sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote control
controlling most of the working design they need to be figured
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
talk about the technical functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design of the remote control
sit at a drastic difference on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design it's gonna be crucial
control so it's one has got lots of buttons could be yellow but we can play
people do most often is changing the channel but that sixty five percent terrain and our views
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
designing several different at the types of user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
appeals to younger people maybe people who have problem with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source
older people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition
complicate like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel
breaks i was given in terms of each was the voice recognition but at the price
wind One large accessible buttons for the essential
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television screen just and some text things and they looking graphics
type in the page number but you before the next meeting in terms of users
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that just received
combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip takes the data to the receiver
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
economic we need to find out find a way of striking a balance between features and price
talk about our functions and our target group that means that is very few we need to each group
bring the data to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
coffee at the end you just only when really going on or even that those things can go out and you're happy
thirty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting on them in the shared folder
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
price limit of the twelve and a half euro to produce
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
settings adjust brightness
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
companies like apple have you might lot of progress
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
