sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote control
parts of the working design they need to be figured
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
working designers figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and that might be older people
people are so is that like change the channel and changing the volume people
device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote
designing several different at the types of user interface is critical
people who have problem with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition
complicate like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
big buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the volume
desire for voice recognition was inverse be related to age
wind One large accessible buttons for the essential
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television
type number but you before the next meeting in terms of users
talk a little bit about functional requirements that just received
combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
battery and that that the chip and convert that much data
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
economic we need to find a way of striking a balance
target group that means that is very few we need to each group
bring the data to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying
button on the tv you can press the middle ring
instruction manual it comes at the end of the spectrum
thirty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple
uh_huh fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
price limit of the twelve and a half euro to produce
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
short amount of time you'll be able to access more of the website
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
settings adjust brightness
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
companies like apple have you might lot of progress
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
