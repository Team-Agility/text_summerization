menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing
play any text on the buttons like labels on the button all the product
buttons will be in special colour But that's important
ipod you just every time you wanna go back in the menu button on the on screen we don't have a teacher
crazy like a lecture mac but you push it was sent to the tv and stick
work relevant people
channel or that would be to changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle
shapes and then discussed of the buttons work together as a team the digital
set of the basic colours not are not text but this is the general
time we had a lot of information and they're the same time
remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria
chief almost all of the design and the outside and yellow that we're corpora
pictures of the different parts of the case that if it looks of the case out of college
talk about here it is it just evaluating how we create this project evaluated
break down the on the agenda that they produce the twelve point
answer every single curved case how many colours what the colours that's curved
device are used the scrolling up and down for a list of justice you find
tend to meetings and then people have a preference as far as feel and functionality
remember really we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons
mine it was like would you prefer an lcd screen or multi-function remote control
how'd you get back to the main menu or submenus and so how'd
functional is also a pretty hard to mess
opinion but if we're now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle
fashionable can you make a remote it's pretty in technology in fashion and so those are the mexicans
stand up like this on your table if you want it to if i made about the bottom flat
chosen not to do a powerpoint saying that they made sense if we had a larger group
latex that whole idea those are like if we had like a brainstorming period
lose i do think that on a scale of one to seven and how easy or hard to press
order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit and chip and trends partners and i wrote
people have like things you can put on the keys that you press it and it'll beep
decisive person's the top to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes
war have the prototype you did you work together or did you like to separate projects
sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons including five research
buy and more market marketing expert could not agree with the marketing
decisions what we need to do is first of all decide on the shape so that it fits in your hands nicely
hand if it's made of latex crap appropriately take that into account
clear and the size of end down at the end of the meeting in rio do the job of making firm decisions
people should really base they're both sort fruit and vegetables in really good like creativity
finally it to production evaluation using the criteria look at the finances
link i what the side i would just get slide subtitles
idea of kinetic battery that's expensive but we have a sample chip
distinctive that it's not just like another be the technology around your house
yellow and grey but on the slogan's and blue are the web page
minutes so that it will include all the agenda and all that fifteen
chairs are like they have the option to select to some other included
net i know you're saying you're a little bit nervous about that i it's a remind
address the fact that it does need to have a corporate website
pen was a little distracting for me personally
solve the gatekeeper grip to it doesn't ring finger for other hand
lightning bolt or not very cute
