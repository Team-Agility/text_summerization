lots of people complain they kind can find your remote control
unique feature of a remote control and let them buttons
power buttons and use one time and the volume

relevance scale the channel selection is the most important
list of Functions decide it and our target audience
attract all the people do not always want to use the voice
decided to implement this a function the technical design
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip set a circuit boards
save cost by not implementing a lot of function
buttons like that which are easy to use we my coat rack
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions
requirement is that we should focus on younger people
user interface connect to chip which is connected to the sender which generates
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume and the programme one and some fancy lighting and techniques blinking lights
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound
market is interested in some advanced new techniques
cell phone just one like in the device to incorporates this technique
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
buy personally we should infer use infrared
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components
expensive and they're hard to implement fancy techniques
goal was a boston move you would like to start
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light
time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
sell about to forty percent of the market
older you might want to constrain that portion market
watching a movie it would can see beep

expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
user-friendly as you feel fifties
