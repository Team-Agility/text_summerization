remote control and talking to it but it still need to points to the television
personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control
possibility for us to use scroll scroll wheel
watching a movie how many times you take the remote control
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
Yellow case and grey buttons
note if you want to use these rubber of the case
casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved
volume button is on the side or the side
scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons
compare the little bit with the big ray image you have in your presentation the big remote control
interface we can have a high-tech in buttons
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular
colours is to back and white forearm i had a market group
curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
feel of the material has to be spongy
fronts On which the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber
voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
colouring is important and soft material but we're since we're cost reading room The younger group
finishing this is what's on the edge what you feel
buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch
banana a telephone telephone from siemens the yellow rubber telephone use it for volume
cell phones which exchangeable cover with the rubber finishing
Point i would like to some issues that would like to point
sample sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip
simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
Ease of use it is important but innovation
yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours
source which brings me to the different energy
move that's the sense of it and you can store
tv when you have to make some energy kinetic energy
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar
understood there are some significant changes in the market
phase source and is the design of the look and find an internet
space in our finance i would say do integrate
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
version of the advanced a version of the chip supports lcd that's all and we've decided
piece of this action to it's that's really the mute
watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of volume
indicators we have the lcd displays
walls the reef like the infrared light
imagine it's a bit like a wave form
cost rating on the young group like fruit and vegetables In their clothes shoes and furniture
back in thirty minutes you will have a prototype
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
talk with our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion
afraid is not possible to print a picture or the size
hit home is the pm
