economics it's probably better to push buttons would recharge the battery
important features for a remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
box is where you press the centre button
lots of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional button
television send information back to the remote control list
people to be able to use it as a remote control
button to switch off in case you get bored
simply it's cheaper to make pushbuttons and it is a scroll button
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel
buttons remain things but then i go back
tend to watch tv i them wanting to say on the tv
decided on like a simple a regular chip
lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen
menu display that comes up on the television
intrigued by the idea of the scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display
determine what the essential functions of the device
shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
fashion in our case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
shaped like a vegetable colours we could colour
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
interface and we'll come back to the chip
minutes a new type things you look and feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
number of different choices for a design concept and start
examine each element separately but we're designing
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
find a way to protect on the inside
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
minute or if you the minutes left of the meeting
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
work together on a prototype using modelling clay
fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
sending it out's only fourteen twenty
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
attend a certain amount of space program
saved it this in the shared project
