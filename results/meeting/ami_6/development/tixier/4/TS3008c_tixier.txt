watchers but remote control can lie on the table for a date and then you push a button
lcd in front of the remote controls are already on the market is simple
talk about the components of a remote control the case the properties of material we have to choose
catch colours fruit and vegetables it has to be colourful
harder but also on the colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour
colour lcd screen and it's very special a very trendy to have a remote control
telling me that when we build a remote control of of plastic or rubber the buttons to that the rubber
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
idea of maybe is a little bit Too much for twelve and a half Abduction
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station at the bottom
buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons you don't need an lcd
mode after the trailers of lcd display on that we do lots of information
idea of maybe at that came kind type of body weight and then with plastic colouration rounded
properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material like a hard plastic
open the conceptual design for a greater resemblance but with new with new colours
functional to indicate which what a device you are controlling test
technical part and the material and then you're gonna have like to material lines
titanium nowadays is way more often used them plastic A screen on top of it isn't for mobile
idea of making a catchy colour design and the them because i do that it dark
talk about the materials it's a good idea to use the plastic and the rubber
image which is it's symbolises the idea of fruit and vegetables in christ stick with the remote control
thousand and four you can't put something on the market which is on the ground
energy source i've got a lot of possibilities And lcd was a possibility to put a scroll button
speaker in the remote control and you want to retrieve it and the base
puts an extra x and on the simplicity of our remotes to make these two most basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
start with the technical things we have to discuss
reaches a different marked but it doesn't cost really much effort to bring a like a black
sell and then tie a title for programme or at least at a quite large part of it and then you get a very large lcd screen
basic buttons to skip channel previous channel with that we were for programs
buttons has to be solid two and the material is soft touch in your hands
design already resemble some piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease
time you would have teletext and the menu nowadays to access the screen settings
spongy thing already comes for in the in the cushions pets and things on this side
easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple electronic all chip is available with the led transmission or a transmitter
back to the costs again but we get a bill but pretty cheap design to see if they within our limits
Drawl really nicely of the best we can put the logo and all that back
easy for you to read the minutes of the second meeting in the shared folder
important because it has to be flash a bit and that is a an doesn't have to be in weighing day
trendy too because that's the mode it it's a it's icsi a extent
ia is still don't have any information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
mobile phone you can read somewhere that i've got some fate fees
combine it or with it yellow and black and white that's on the old grey
top and when you have a table for more than two weeks she just gets annoying because it still be too flashy
fond of of fronts like we can use on the telephone
skip the house as easy
nineties maybe what we're up to write from to this point
emission know it's like more phone row ball and it adds
switch from softer works it's also too much to the lawn wanna spend
coverage when you go to the living room
