cost we should just go for push buttons which is what real reaction
important features for a remote is seen a menu button so that we can access
hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
keeping a very small and simple set of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional button we have are in have like black with red sitting
television send information back to the remote control list
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control
button to switch off in case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
simply it's cheaper to make pushbuttons and it is a scroll thing would be too fast
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel flipping and then the other white
main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons remain things but then i go back
tend to watch tv i them wanting to say on the tv and watch
chip we can have a simple one a regular chip to keep our costs
lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
menu like contrast and tuning the vcr i've understood you could rather than menu
intrigued by the idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
model is a going to be for user interaction with this device going to work
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
fashion in our case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
buttons could be shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours maybe free vegetable colours
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
concept of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface and we'll come back to the chip
minutes a new type things you look and feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
examine each element separately but we're designing
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
find a way to protect on the inside
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
plastic but we have all these fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
sending it out's only fourteen twenty
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
moving on to market research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options that we have for manufacturing
attend a certain amount of space program
saved it this in the shared project
