rubber push button so But you have to move
rabbit double curve then we have to go for rubber push buttons
case of the remote itself and they can be a general case which is just a flat a curved
working with the there's gonna be a rubber casing the week and sellers from and funky
choosing a Solar cells then we can choose titanium and if we choosing
double curve then we've got the choice for the case do you want it to facts or curved
fancy and it's different but i wouldn't say like a rubber the ritual
easy to have a button it just prevents the other buttons ideally
walk in a like a remote control is designs to the complete opposite
story they're gonna see like three or four normal remote site a big spongy pink to tomato remote
Technologically it should be like work i it should work together on this year
variety of colours that people feel like the customising it wanna buy it just by the fact that choosing
ten to movement that it won't give it the energy to work
squeezing of the rubber be the generating like the energy generator
puts even the customer into more control over what the boring instead of you call colours
pushbuttons and sell it can be just simple button could be like a big apple
inside the unit it doesn't affect whether the customers gonna buy this one level you got a remote
settings it should be technologically innovative
discussed earlier on the or at sri problem what we should choose so for the energy
country you'll get lots of people go for the don't really care
remote control market These are like most important aspect it is it's easy
research and they do have they are they would and they complain about our story and this is anti rsi
press of all what i'm saying like move away from the current remote controls that like the look-and-feel fancier
market it never have to change the battery
expensive part of a remote without any actual interesting functionality is for is operating the tv
colour scheme of the company you were running it's just so were in black
suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an mp three player like ipod
guessing but it's gonna be the most expensive option
anti rsi and as you squeeze it if every piece is a rising yourself you are charging the battery
crucial as far as what keys we're going to include what buttons we're going to include in another laid out so the manufacturing
colours like like a black with yellow line is the blue line is the green lines
speech recognition and against going a pretty new thing in each sense it should be more general
gabriel you're gonna be working on come up with that the user interface
consulted with our manufacturing department sunday like captain was also speaking it's know as advanced but that's a job
sense have something that's little more technologically advanced and what's on the market
chip on print which up it was one bc And that's got all the electronics one board
company has its fingers a lot of different share in spite stock
personal preferences if we've all talked about and seem to be on the same page
meeting be able to come in and show us so my same physical ideas at the moment
sample sensor sample of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products like the coffee machine
ideally it like power channel five and a chance to play with some clay
hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmick you wrote
younger kids and all the could like teenagers will like it specially
Nah to tell of it the television would have to be a play to use compatible
told you that they wanted whatever our product to represent the rr brand in to be immediately noticeable
room and try to thirty children
telling it's not saying do anything stick it is so maybe you should collect
text it's fast and a very much in fruit and vegetables of them are like they have theme for cloths shoes and furniture
back maybe to see the previous slide
giving them a way to burn off steam
