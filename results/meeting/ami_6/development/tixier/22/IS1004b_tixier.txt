research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
extra internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
time corporate to do with the remote control you start and then you stop
focusing on tv but still like a universal remote in that as a replacement remote control or is this something for a reminder of televisions
remote control have been have remain the same for the last five ten years
feed the targets in front of cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
requirements i'd give it a marketing report is to tv remote court
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
people are what it about the shape of the remote control when they broke brought to hold
button it increases the difficulty of find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech recognition
priced a remote control it would really be worth us on that would be worth implementing
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen you just scroll for that program rubber band to a channel
application and then shape of the button is important but also it the number of buttons
programme name instead of the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big
working design is so user interface
top of the could be a speech recognition system it might be a bit difficult
pretty wide range of remote control shouldn't be very they have looked pretty comfortable if you want to get this and on top
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
industrial designer should work was supposed to work on and so on the working
watching tv you can have a lot of these background noise in the tv which might interfere
simple there's only a few buttons but what each of those buttons does something different in a different context
cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
screen except for the really main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared to also use going to implement
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press a button
functional requirements and especially for the For the user requirements like a big courting all those things are required and for wise
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
store some time for me to to bring you to some new way you informations
usual those buttons which there so that the user interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology switch at existing
idea but as a marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition
hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should be similar to the traditional
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
teletext but we want to get read one of four requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
bring testing sings i have seen them on the one that's got a welcome pick it or is this we'll that we can use to navigate
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
question is to you open about this cd
electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
selling the potential of the device in use a potentially you can then do a look like change the lights and i close the windows what about the heating
opinion there My and all these mine though shouldn't be bit smaller
eds they're more like and they good idea is to it looks like a year
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting the green one and it can watch
english it sounds like them and school you know men
