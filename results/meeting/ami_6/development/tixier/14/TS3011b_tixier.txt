buttons connected the buttons
design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
lots of people complain they kind can find your remote control
unique feature of a remote control and let them buttons
power buttons and use one time and the volume
method of the remote control is just a function of remote
press it and your tv set starts to make a weights out and your remote control
user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control
imagine when you only have a set like to go there and you have about six on the channel switching
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to change the channel
user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
device has to do is to send messages to tv set
easier way of a round button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
channel selection is the most important function In one button
list of Functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all function available device
attract all the people do not always want to use the voice
decided to implement this a function and can be implemented in in our design
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip set a circuit boards
thumb Determine the cost by not implementing a lot of function
opinion the it be easy to use we my coat rack
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions
requirement is that we should focus on younger than forty
user interface connect to chip which is connected to the sender which generates
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume and the programme one and some fancy lighting and techniques blinking lights
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound
market is interested in some advanced techniques and the user friendliness
cell phone just one like in the device to incorporates this technique
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
buy personally we should infer use infrared
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components
main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
goal was a boston move you would like to start
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light
time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
part off the market isn't the forty percent we Want to sell
older you might want to constrain that portion market would respond to a simple
watching a movie it would can see beep
home station for base station next to see this a little antenna
fully concentrate on developing a product that is really what the market
summary of all things are spoken and the different concept
power saving will be a bit more difficult so we can expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
user-friendly as you feel fifties
seconds i received some new project documents folder
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
