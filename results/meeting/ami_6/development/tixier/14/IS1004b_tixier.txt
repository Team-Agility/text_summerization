research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
roles in addition to the t what should be a special
restrict the remote control you start and then you stop
focusing on tv but still like a universal remote in that as a replacement remote control or is this something for a reminder of televisions
present this presentation that is what we want the remote control
remote as one bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost
requirements i'd give it a marketing report is to tv remote court
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
people are what it about the shape of the remote control
button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
keen on going to speech recognition to adjust and that can fit
talk about price point to To find out a solution
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen
number of button to enter to do and then the summer
internet connectivity would be to have this programme name instead of the channel
television where you can say change the lighting in the courts
working design is so user interface
top of the could be a speech recognition system it might be a bit difficult
scroll was actually pretty a pretty wide range of remote controls
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
industrial designer should work was supposed to work on the components concepts
background noise in the tv or we have control of the tv
groups or you could even have some buttons like on the sides
cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important
move to another does it because i twenty five dollars
screen except for the really main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
relation to know you would be cheaper as compared to also use going to implement
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak
press a button to talk and the tvt v set
functional requirements and especially for the For the user requirements like a big courting all those things are required and for wise
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
programme you could have a start time but on the On the chip
user interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology
idea but as a marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition
wheel which is it's a really important design should be similar to the traditional
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
master a very easy to handle to scroll not too big
focus more on the internet aspects because you see the text is outdated
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
question is to you open about this cd
electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
selling the potential of the device You'll do we have problems
existing so deeply the book would be which is the easiest
scd e still on this get used to open to discussion
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting the green one and it can watch
