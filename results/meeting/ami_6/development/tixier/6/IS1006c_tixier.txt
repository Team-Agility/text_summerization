easy to use as a remote control
process i'm thinking about that either part you could argue that the remote control
general people change tv more often than batteries on their remote control
simple button and speech recognition technology
device on that can be used for speech recognition
recogniser so we want to reduce
back and not to look at a new remote controls it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons
people the young people want to be different from their friends
lighting we have many options in the market
expensive since we want to port some other features that speech recognition you want the radios
chip technology and it's more expensive
colours of like fruits and vegetables and spongy
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and battery
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology inside
market of remote controls they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention
location and these people are really interesting on those features
concept of the interface we used and if there is some supplements
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser
paints that can colours around and depending on the temperature
sixty then you make a lot of money
mark the user interface design
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
week about the last year now it has to be spongy
chip do we have only the plastic or that cd five or A chip
important thing it has to be fancy
touchpad it just a display for the tv you information
source of information is the weather
tomatoes and It's that easy they're rubber is expensive
propose but the use of solar cells
chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive compared to lcd
end we find out that it's not feasible in terms of sponginess
selling point maybe it has to be the base
shape it has to be more wrong than the More roo look natural
follow smart should be some not too complicated
record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
talk about with their friends mine has this and that euros And finally
component to use for energy and the media and the interface for energy
friends you can travel from golf to furniture so it might be fruit and vegetable
phone we can use the phone as a good to Example of work to it beeps back
inventing it You're creating the trend i hope i'm going to try to help you want that this is more risky
reduce the cost on the display
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
red goes faster than the life
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
body one call really come up with our forties
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that Mark and then sandy
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning
puts lots of concentrate
