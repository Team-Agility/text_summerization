shape than a normal remote controls we must use rubber buttons
Basic remote control from our plastic
idea because you if you and you drop your remote control and remote controls
document be sent to the station of the remote control in a recharger
compared to the basic buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons
pretty standard these rubber buttons are wish there should be on top
switch channel up and down button and that takes a few buttons more often than the normal channel of the time
Light switches on if you use a button you knew a lot more like the that meant that and they three player
volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake
current controllers are all black and plastic it's that our problem
change it you wanna change the volume only if you use your finger
difference if you put this this switch channels on side of it on top
modern remote controls the buttons are part of the just it's part of the remote control
important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel instead of the current functional look-and-feel so it's very important
numbers should be in the bottom and the switch channel in the middle

real reaction logo as on the remote controls so the colours blue red and green colour the backlight
buttons normal rubber like normal ordinary buttons soft

decided that we don't to make use of a lcd or speech recognition
yellow on the side and black on the front in red and yellow and blue
sense if you put it somewhere in the chances the beautiful scroll
top band that if we gonna put in more technology eugene need to be able to switch to open
expensive chip We need if we doing if we're doing a display
personal thing is that we should go more modern look and d player
receive any information on speech recognition
divide you have to round it on the button and of skip
chip can be a simple a regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced
energy source we can use batteries just a rechargeable battery that's cheaper
date display in the ipod a compared to the basic or you can choose
shape should be curved So round shapes not nothing square
original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod the cell
see-through one in a fruit front so we put on the market
design so i did some searching on the internet
low if we will a lot of room to put in as logo
strange that i receive an email with a few possibilities on the materials
tad next aspect also in contrast to last year the feel of material suspect it is expected to be spongy
zapping is the highest priority
clothes shoes the ta
people that want to spend money on something that's similar to a cheaper
show you the And i the the menu to that what's it called
target group we talk about was young and trendy
