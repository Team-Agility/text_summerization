solution whole we can have some cheap like that on the remote control
live in conversation with your remote control so i was all the idea that we can have to power supply
remote is going to have what they interfaces scroll as as button
build you could link the recognition on a certain phrase to some function on the remote control
hold like the way you the end of the banana and plastic
powerful are powered by a man though it's a button on the fruit
suggested that we have some wheels to control the volume and channel
buttons are in the fit of shape of banana if you want to point
bite the things that by nine that and the base a station
design for a coffee machine you notice a hell are in the morning
concentrating on like a fruit or you want to some like fruit logo
regular chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana
worth but it doesn't really add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech recognition the speech
cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production components
design and you have to work on the user interface
plastic with some elasticity so that if you're of the remote control what's the sample sensor sample speaker
people would find out what's it even if it wasn't a recharging station even if they didn't have to buy batteries
theoretical usability committee point without worrying too much about how to develop
banana you can you hold it like this and have the scroll wheel on top
scroll past television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations
designed to be square so they'd attack start it in the boxes
decided not to go for speech recognition technology that we can add keywords speech
fits in the hand and you had a lot of so phase two The for the controls
beep or people are more the devastating never find a fancy look and feel down in the technology gonna be know in innovation
hot out of a device that may be difficult to can have to build

functionality could be used for pressing the mobile phone which has been misplaced
volume up volume is it's it's very handy or as compared to the setting

gap so you'd have to worry too much about the case the chip a lot is going to be sitting inside
city's would not be possible to implement it for the next prototype
additional it will be might be having slightly better market
real recognise i he was but he was in a set target
thin veneer of wood that's got a grinding you put some of an agenda
ripple it's all the ideas we've had we had doing these presentations presentation to perform
decided that we can and spend twenty five euros is that profit
double curve would actually menu and you could like drawer something on on the whiteboard
microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big
