remote control and talking to it but it still need to points to the television
personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control a yellow
possibility for us to use scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons
watching a movie and you haven't move the remote a remote control in the in an amount of time Any wanted to switch the channel
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
Yellow case and grey buttons
note if you want to use these rubber with one curve User
casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved or flat case that's the most common remote can control form
volume button and either on the side or the side a of remote control would be perfect
scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons
compare the little bit with the big ray image you have in your presentation the big remote control
high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular
colours is to back and white forearm i had a market group
casing is curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
customers specifically ask for the spongy feel of the material has to be spongy
discussion the digits six on the bus and it will disappear when it's from rubber
voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
colouring is important and soft material but we're since we're cost reading room The younger group
forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic
buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch
banana a telephone telephone from siemens the yellow rubber telephone use it for volume
cell phones which exchangeable cover with the rubber finishing
Point i would like to some issues that would like to point
suggest we use the sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip
stick with the simple as straightforward and not curve design and it's too dull
fruit and vegetables are important but innovation is more important than Ease of use for the our target group
yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours
latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cell solution for the energy
kinetic thing it is it's possibility is more sense of it and you can store
mine doesn't have kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it's against the wall
possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries and solar panel and hand dynamo
bet i understood that the market is decide as a little older
talk about all the different components wire in this design of the look and find an internet
space in our finance i would say do integrate some functions
uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
version of the advanced a version of the chip supports lcd that's all and we've decided
piece of this action with which you believe it is you use a mute
watch in a display or which channel you have chosen like that often the amount of volume
indicators we have the lcd displays
walls the reef like the infrared light
imagine it's very goal to talk to a device with you have two points to another device
cost rating on the young group like fruit and vegetables In their clothes shoes and furniture
back in thirty minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
talk with our manufacturing division is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion
afraid is not possible to print a picture or the size
hit home is the pm
