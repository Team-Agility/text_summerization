watchers but remote control for double functions maybe buttons like that and to control that's lcd
spongy material is very irritating for the remote controls in a look at two colours
components of remote control the case the properties of material we have to choose
fruits and vegetables it has to be colourful
colours are you are many colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour
colour lcd screen and it's very special a very trendy to have a remote control
remote doubled curved case you must use or rubber the buttons to that the rubber
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
set the idea is that a good idea we have already mentioned all arguments
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station at the bottom
normal stay buttons and it should and the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
mode after the trailers of lcd display on that we do lots of information
idea of maybe at that came kind type of body weight and then with plastic colouration rounded
properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material like a hard plastic
open the conceptual design for a greater resemblance but with new with new colours
functional to indicate which what a device you are controlling test
technical part and the material and then you're gonna have like to material lines
plastic is the best with rubber of wood or titanium Would also be a bit weird
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people dark colours simple recognisable shapes
basic idea to use the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights
pictures of fruit it's flexible and vegetables And spongy material I found this image
thousand and four you can't put something on the market likes really like set
email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility to put a scroll button
base station is also off the shelf also the speaker and wireless retriever are all available in our company
match with that or old basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
start with the technical things we have to discuss
reaches a different marked but it doesn't cost really much effort to bring one line with the dark colour
part of the rc The up and the upper part or whatever it's it's not use wood buttons
tv guide only for the channel with that we were for programs
breaks it's not very solid two and the material is soft rubber for falling and it feels
design already resemble some piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease
time you would have teletext and the menu nowadays to access the screen settings
save a perhaps a some tiny buttons aren't user-friendly then we wouldn't can implement
easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple design which sturdy
drop it if you drop it back began a resolution with it the goal is backs and colours
Drawl really nicely of the best we can put the logo and all that back
easy for you to read the minutes in you can find them in the proper
important because it has to be flash a bit and that is a an doesn't have to be in weighing day
trendy too because that's the mode it it's a it's icsi a extent
ia is still don't have any information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
base things we'll read discuss the know fees
combine it or with it yellow and black and white that's on the old grey
top and when you have a table for more than two weeks she just gets annoying because it still be too flashy
fond of of fronts like we can use on the telephone
skip the house as easy
nineties maybe what we're up to write from to this point
emission know it's like more phone row ball and it adds
switch from softer works it's also too much to the lawn wanna spend
coverage when you go to the living room
