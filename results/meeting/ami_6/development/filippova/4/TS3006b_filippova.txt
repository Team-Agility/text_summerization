easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
easy so for just a zapping around channels you can just push one button
menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
screen is all the configuration options you can put that on the screen menu
showed up put the the extra advanced options all model to the on screen display
time you have one button access the menu it or you can incorporate two different buttons
normal functions the basic function if you are going to use the advanced options are going to press
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional requirements
feel of the left example and then the screen is on top which function
channels and left or right for the volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons
buttons to press the menu button and then you are certainly into the the display
problem with the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen is below and the buttons are in the middle
channel five on channel settings or channel programming your channels in the right order
power button and channel volume selection present the numbers present
pretty handy for advanced a advanced one but a lot of options and functions
indy it's the remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
User interface designer can design menu For all these functions
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program the channels
larger public we have more options are activated based on some so for options
integrate the screen or speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
design of the bus buttons but look how you can push them and like that so the physical aspect
corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote
confirm a want to go one step back to it to upper level the finally
week or on the channel number in a remote and which want to save
idea because then it becomes clear about the extra two buttons or active
reach a little bit for the power cable when you go back
department do we need just the functional display and for curses
match the operating behaviour of the users are not afraid of a lot of functions
functions and on the Seems was it the target group so it's above forty
annoying most small phones and also have a screen like on a mobile phone also on top
remote like this if you put it on the top and then make the corporate logo
tv options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble on base
irrelevant the less use for audio settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
signal of certain spatial frequencies it's a counters one it shows on your tv
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
clear distinction between age groups concerning the features but we just have to build them in because they find
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television it's difficult
news flash and teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
additional process or and also for part you don't have to design
product should reach a new market which is the customers below forty
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information
people of sixteen to forty is it from twenty to forty years of thirty
rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break and then we can work
received an email so i'd like we'll use so i'd just drop it in the folder
overrides the previous and previous
overview of what we discussed in our last Meeting
called a cold lasts
lli d and then just was typing it so that all i have to that so switch
