remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote control
controlling most of the working design presentation i have a pet
energy going to the user interfaces controlling the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
talk about the technical functions presentation working design how the apparatus can fulfil its function
button them i'm gonna buy a new remote all they want like an upgrade
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and the relevant the polls buttons
people are so is that like change the channel and changing the volume people
personally what i want from a remote control is a device which is fairly conventional in design
fifty percent of the people specifically said that it's not remotes were ugly seventy
industrial design if you're components concept user interface the user interface concept market trend were watching
people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people
designed to like this you have your energy source people don't wanna be changing
older people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
focus in and those volumes and channel changing the volume changing the channel settings
feel like voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
wind One large accessible buttons for the essential
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television and the power
type numbers but you before the next meeting in terms of users
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that just received
combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
brings energy source the battery and that that the chip and convert that much data
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find a balance between features and price
deadline the target group that means that is very few we need to each group
bring the data to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
instruction manual it comes at the end that's and hot because of the combination
minutes i emailed them to you and also putting on them in the shared folder
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics
price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
features and price as you mentioned something called rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
settings adjust brightness
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
companies like apple have you might lot of progress
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
