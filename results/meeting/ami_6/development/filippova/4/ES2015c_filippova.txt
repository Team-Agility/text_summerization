raised up buttons So you can feel
links into the different depends on what type of buttons or just the push button
research into the different components that we could use what's available to us to actually make the remote control test
choice of buttons what functions will show
buttons are you don't necessarily need to have it on remote for more simplistic style
back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control
phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons
agenda for this so this particular meeting conceptual design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
actual remote would be hard plastic and put it in rubber can get on top
complicated and the controls would be more user interface design so those are the trendy
decided that the command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television that people have in the kitchen
Pop in tarot will have to work with rubber has already given the market
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates are busily to keep in mind
stick graphical user you must need some presentation for the graphics like an lcd
learn from mistakes of all are interface that can be too complicated for people
kinetic thing was stressed about lies it's instant energy then you can store the energy
buttons so one same colour it's face could have its own colour of button
kinetic energy source idea that's been used by some watches and that devices where you just shake in the device and it gives it to power
numbers of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power
end so more internal casing and the rubber case which we pulled aside and rubber
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
silly if we do point to have anything else just have to not important
strip it down to like really basic shape
important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be technologically innovative
meeting again in thirty minutes to finish our meeting we talked about our favourite animals
regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house cat our dog
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual components so we'd have to get it in separately
difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
include good like ten to earlier there are these different options
due to the fruit and vegetable things if that's going to work for us sound
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
source is not necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
Display anyway you that will probably won't have to focus so much not be more than the numbers
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
flat then i got like on a cell phone a mobile phone so called a flat
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentations
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
amount of time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
looked at the design reports from previous years here real remote
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real
audio settings mono stereo pitch
information We need to start making some more specific decisions
