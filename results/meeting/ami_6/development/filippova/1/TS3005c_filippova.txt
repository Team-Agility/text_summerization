pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
notice there's used you have a remote control
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
work with the lcd screen was a rather small
button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons
hand there and then you want touch the screen
important thing people like to last year was that the remote
called like what's the trends from past years
meets more the young people than older people
rubber rubber is still the rubber isn't fancy
fat people would effect thinking of press three buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button
colours will be easier to do in colour
touch options that so then we have an example of And then you should get the other options
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
screen they don't need that big difference between young
square shape sit around got on the round
called cults settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu
young people they liked fruity colours like red yellow
simple
hard part of this or softer rubber should be soft
buttons won't get that small when a cds green
cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
menu or just you just wanted to know the volume selection
remembered and menu to go back from the floor
plain normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
user interface are also some questions about the concepts you have some ideas
recharge through docking station so that's charges
change a scroll with the menu to look up some some channels on your television
colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
easy way to a program that you say record
chip and we have that's it's possible to scratchy
chargeable with an option for mount station
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium
soft but if you should the feelings spongy use of sponge bob like face
point we already decided that on the previous meeting
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
schools it is in the actual design
square and round corners put a little in the middle
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
question mark how much we spy thing with energy
ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
question and three seconds later you say the answer
lasting not not be anti it's a two minutes
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
prepared a little presentation will we on your side
lay flat down on table
edit issue to remove degrees
