pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
recognise does the remote control concepts
screen i how much the actual remote
main you can fit the lcd screen
button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons
hand there and then you want touch the screen
important thing people lose the remote
called like what's the trends from past years
meets more the young people than older people
rubber rubber is still the rubber isn't fancy
button you are pressing the right moment
colours will be easier to do in colour
touch options you can't go back
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
personally lights the single curved rubber
screen they don't need that big difference between young
square shape sit around got on the round
called cults settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu
young people they liked fruity colours like red yellow
simple
Real hard so rubber should be soft
buttons won't get that small when a cds green
chip on print think cases are points
menu or just you just wanted to know the volume selection
remembered and menu to go back
plain normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
user interface are also some questions about the concepts you have some ideas
recharge through docking station so that's charges
change a scroll with the menu
colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
easy way to a program that you say record
chip and we have that's it's possible to scratchy
chargeable with an option for mount station
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium
press it in its feels kinda
switch it just from the previous meeting
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
schools it is in the actual design
square and round corners put a little in the middle
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
question mark how much we spy thing with energy
ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition
show some points on which we it should take a decision
question and three seconds later you say the answer
meeting is once again in thirty minutes
today i elaborate on the concept
prepared a little presentation will we on your side
lay flat down on table
