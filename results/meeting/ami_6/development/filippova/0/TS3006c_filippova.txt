colours you where you can make it so make the colours that let's beneath the buttons
prefer to be even keep the simple buttons
confirmation button scroll this is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons
basic at trendy design everybody save

pop up screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches
interface type where the forum search the function
blue and then very bright yellow banana or and or a it's a green apple

decided kinetic provision of energy source
fancy look-and-feel it's the most important point of attention
materials rubber it can be done you can harm
call meaning so that's a dark
