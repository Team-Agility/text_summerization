raised up buttons So you can feel
research team of phones and in new multiple all options scroll buttons or just the push button
research into the different components that we could use what's available to us to actually make the remote control test
choice of buttons what functions will show
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control them all these patterns
phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons
agenda for this so this particular meeting conceptual design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
actual remote would be hard plastic and put it in rubber can get on top
complicated and the controls would be more user interface design so those are the trendy look with user-friendliness
command interface requires you to type text role commands and input at the keyboard so the numbers
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television that people have in the kitchen
solar power not maybe not working how we will be working on the look and feel design
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates are busily to keep in mind
stick graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point device
explain what the user interface to make it more trendy and we still have the money
fully kinetic thing was stressed about lies it's instant energy then you can store the energy
buttons so one same colour it's face could have its own colour of button
kinetic energy source idea that's been used by some watches and that devices where you just shake in the device and it gives it to power
numbers of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and you cannot any power
end so more internal casing and the rubber coating which is on the case which we pulled aside and rubber
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
silly if we do point to have anything else just have to not important
strip it down to like really basic shape
important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be technologically innovative and hope
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting we talked about our favourite animals
regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
weapon for the simple the weight that was the advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual components so we'd have to get it in separately
titanium is not to be possible in know it just to be on top budget
circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
include good like ten to earlier there are these different options
due to the fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
source is not necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
Display anyway you that will probably won't have to focus so much not be more than the numbers
popular thing we came up out of your market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange to we speak rating
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
flat then i got like on a cell phone a mobile phone so called a flat
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty
lee back inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentations
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
method was mainly web-based research this time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
looked at the design reports from previous years here real remote
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real swimming or a store
audio settings mono stereo pitch
information We need to start making some more specific decisions
