cost we should just go for push buttons which is what real reaction
menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
keeping a very small and simple set of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
depending them a week at a buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting
television send information back to the remote control list
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control get a certain amount of a light
main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as or the case you get bored
thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast
buttons for your favourite channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons remain things but then i go back
time when you're watching tv in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons
decided on like a simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip depending
lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
ri uses for buttons to me to move around so range of settings so on a small lcd screen
menu like contrast and tuning the vcr i've understood you could rather than menu
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
idea of the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display would have to be quite small
model is a going to be for user interaction with this device itself is useful purpose
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case it can have any titanium
changeable covers like for your mobile in different fruit and vegetable or like i don't like a carrot source
main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time i am imagining
essential properties of the user interface we have to decide on whether i have a scroll
minutes a new type things you look and feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
specific functions to keep the remote from getting lost a large buttons for the essential functions a possibility for extra functions and the more advanced features
switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
examine each element separately but we're designing
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
screen there are on the actual tv if you're changing the brightness on trying to see it happening
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
find a way to protect like the chip
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on how should report are produced
hit my understanding of old latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
sending it out's only fourteen twenty
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
trendwatch market research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options that we have for manufacturing
attend a certain amount of space program
saved it this in the shared project
