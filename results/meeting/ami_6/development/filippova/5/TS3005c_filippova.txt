pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
decision on the remote control a lot of people we'll i dropped remote control on a break
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
main you can fit the lcd screen just use and all sex or another as cleaning consulting
small because you have how much nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the lcd screen
hand there and then you want touch the screen
important thing people like to last year was that the remote control should be look fancy
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly people
meets more the young people can see it because it is the unique
rise to shine and rubber the total piece of rubber is still the rubber isn't fancy
fat people would effect thinking of press three buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button
buy Not faster when they look the same old grey or black the colours
touch options that so then we have an example of And then you should get the other options
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
big difference between young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
shapes it is something between the square shape sit around got on the round squares simple
options is the settings of the remote enough to tv and that a thing called cults settings
young people they liked fruity colours like reading brown light out dark red yellow green blue
simple
round shapes As soft with the materials like the rubber is the best suits poll up material
sound and the channel buttons won't get that small when a cds green
chip on print think cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
remote control has no way or in the settings menu for button channel volume selection four times an hour
remembered and menu to go back good morning joe or which made this and this the easy
printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
questions about the design and user interface there are going to work together on for a foundering a smartboard
recharge through docking station so that's charges
settings menu to look up some some channels on your television use is called a scroll
colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
easy way to a program that you say record into the device into the speaker
chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip
chargeable with an option for mount station
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard materials like wood the titanium
soft but if you should the feelings spongy use of sponge bob like face
switch it just from the previous meeting that they should we should use our own business colours
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
schools it is in the actual design
find something in the middle ground that square and round corners put a little in the middle
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
sense that it you ask you give a question mark how much we spy thing with energy
bigger for microphone for the speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
meeting is once again in thirty minutes or thirty minutes of forty minutes of use Nx
elaborate something today we once again have a three presentations at home
agenda the base five presentation is once again or at least an agenda
lay flat down on table
