shape than a normal remote controls we must use rubber buttons
Basic remote control from our plastic
sense that is the most important thing or four remote controls as good morning remote control
document be sent to the station of the remote control and the recharger
basic buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons like text easy to put that on the button
pretty standard these rubber buttons are wish there should be on top
switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel up button is like you switch channel
back that you'll get the button you knew a lot more like the that meant that and they three player
putting the volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake
current controllers are all black and plastic it's that our problem
drop it you wanna change it if you already bought of the remote control
difference if you put this this switch channels on side of it on top
modern remote controls the buttons are part of the just it's part of the remote control
find that the most important aspect is that you must make it fancy and it looks original
left or right is more often associating with volume and top down is more with the channel it's on the bottom
spec to the remote control should be easy to know me for a push to the yup
man a young public you should use materials or soft with primary colours blue red and green
buttons normal rubber like normal ordinary buttons soft
called scroll-wheel make it in yellow just like the colours of real reaction
fancy because of the lights on the bottom that's what difference
features and then that this is a point is still is that i've no not a technological innovative
integrated in the chip so if we use speech recognition it would be better to implement lcd
fronts in red and yellow and it did the top and black and yellow the world
sense if you put it somewhere in the chances the beautiful scroll
top band that if we gonna put in more technology eugene need to be able to switch to open
expensive most expensive chip We need if we doing if we're doing a display
personal thing is that we should go more modern look and d player
receive any information on speech recognition
divide you have to round it on the button and of skip
display requires an advanced chip can be a simple a regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced
room no just battery context like normal batteries just a rechargeable batteries expense
product you by your get one and more basic or you can choose one if you buy the project
shape should be curved So round shapes not nothing square
original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod the cell
de curved is like front to the back and three d curves
design so i did some searching on the internet
low if we will a lot of room to put in as logo
strange that i receive Information about the cost but just a about the chip
tad next aspect also in contrast to last year the feel of material suspect it is expected to be spongy
zapping is the highest priority
clothes shoes the ta
people that want to spend money on something that's similar devices and my own common knowledge
show you the And i the the menu to that what's it called
target group we talk about was young and trendy
wise
