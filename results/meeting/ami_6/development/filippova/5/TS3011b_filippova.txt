buttons connected the buttons
dec design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find your remote control
main important thing what a remote control and the advanced remote controls and let them buttons
power buttons and use one time and the volume
remote controls the multi function of remote control is to send messages to the television set
press it and your tv and press that button because they are lost the remote controls
user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control Because the user
channel nineteen you only have that button or change the channel or to not the volume
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to change the channel
remotes are reports it we give back to the user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
device can have communicate with almost every tv set would have such a button you would have to walk you tv
easier way of a round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button
relevance scale the channel selection you have them to most important or volume and programme selecting
function at the Functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all functions available device
important button And there are lots of people do not always want to use the voice
multi function and can be implemented in in our design or energy save design we should really implement
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip set a circuit boards
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
buttons like that which are easy to use rc is the best one possibility
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet is replacing teletext
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
cheaper that the chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions
focus on customers are the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people
rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected to free things user interface
problem is it but it depends on the decisions disease up in this since it's the best and makes about the voice recognition
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find the one solution
money we say if we using this we can use for an average fancy lights and all that fancy
idea to think about these buttons trendy design lightning what and the sound from other sounds
find a balance between the advanced new techniques and the user friendliness
hebrew i bet devices to incorporates this technique a used in this equipment
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
buy personally we should infer use infrared
specially designs and energy friendly components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components
main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
generates a few times within that a certain period of time to perform are individual work
younger parts off the market isn't the forty percent to make the five million
older you might want to constrain that portion market is to tell million units
watching a movie it would can see beep
home station for base station next a tv is a bus with nancy
products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
dark concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
power saving will be a bit more difficult so we can expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries
user-friendly as you feel fifties
seconds i received some new project documents folder
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
