product based on the user requirements whether it meets the user requirements or not this product and end
fashionable to have these products in the shape of fruits to give a range of products so they of shaped
buttons would be like individual users
idea but evaluation line in additional do all of our product
design it may be a meeting all the requirements of the customers like it technology wise price
shift button maybe start
shaped like a way see look at this as think of is to operate a given radio
type non at the buttons one was in a few buttons you can flip the redness
mind that the specifications are we had to frame vegetables are quite popular and that people like something that is good to look at it and not many buttons
rubber to your we are using the scroll buttons and it's gonna cost is for doing point six euros
product should be as customers requirement as but let us technology and it should be wiring to save
company strategy so i would go for a one as we know only get to it but we were limited
providing quality products not only incorporating latest technology is but also in terms of writing in my mind turns
technology it's got the latest trends in speech technology
marketing strategy of the company is quite rare bird in the market

user requirement is essentially just to operate a tv
designs like we have everyone banana design was she was a very interface expert radio
project evaluation we have on the crap out here is fifty Project evaluated that is mine
company all have The you can choose from a company on have two or three trace it is but the different designs

traditional remote control conforms to the company strategy is that the question
curve in this one is single curve on that all have and the double curved is it on both sides
end times leds as but if a latest fashion trend
ideas like glow in the dark like that we discussed
Eleven or other euros i was thinking That we could have a sense of the same shape but just have a flat
scroll once we still could be channel up and down and volume
electronics it's not always quite say you don't always have so many choices is with talk
case giving only one or two traces we are leaving limiting all customers and by limiting
material da will tell you can work this is we're going to discuss
keeping it keeping in mind all the safety issues
holiday pay maybe in order
