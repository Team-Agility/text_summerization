remember that remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote control
controlling most of the working design presentation i have a pet
energy going to the user interfaces controlling the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
technical functions presentation working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
frozen he can show me to pick up the remote all they want like an upgrade
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
lots of buttons and the relevant the polls buttons could be yellow but we can play
people do most often is changing the channel but that sixty five percent terrain and our views
personally what i want from a remote control is a device which is fairly conventional in design
people are only using ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote
industrial design if you're components concept user interface the user interface concept market trend were watching
people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people
team make a schematic of the way that the energy source people don't wanna be changing
older people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
big buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the volume changing the channel
feel like voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
wind One large accessible buttons for the essential
button on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or focused
type numbers but you before the next meeting in terms of users
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that just received
combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip transmitting information to the chip and convert that much data
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
economic we need to find out find a way of striking a balance between features and price
talk about our functions and our target group that means that is very few we need to each group
bring the data to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
coffee at the end you just only when really going on or even that those things can go out and you're happy
thirty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting on them in the shared folder
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
features and price as you mentioned something called rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
settings adjust brightness
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
companies like apple have you might lot of progress
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
