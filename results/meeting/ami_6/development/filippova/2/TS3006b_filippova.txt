easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
easy so for just a zapping around channels you can just push one button
menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
position of the screen menu screen is also more essential
showed up put the the extra advanced options all model to the on screen display
time you have one button access the menu in the lcd screen
normal functions the basic functions you normally press to the menu button
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option
relevant the most used functions only use the extra function
screen is on top which function is that we have left
navigate the channels and volume channel up and down screen
buttons to press the menu button and then you are certainly into the the display
problem with the button in the middle or you should screen
channel five on channel settings or channel programming your channels
power button and channel volume selection present the numbers present
advanced a advanced options and functions and buttons is easy
indy it's the remote control options so we need to menus
User interface designer can design menu For all these functions
harder to if you have already program it to swap
extra options are activated based on some so for options
integrate the screen or speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote
step back to it to upper level which twos and focus
select a number in a remote and which want to save
idea because then it becomes clear about the extra two buttons
reach a little bit for the power button if you grab
functions your hand will block the display and for curses
marketing research stated that users are not afraid of a lot of functions
functions and on the Seems was it the target group below forty
people use mobile phones and also have a screen on top
remote like this if you put it on the top of sweet
tv options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble on base
settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour
working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
signal of certain spatial frequencies it's a counters one it shows on your tv
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
features are hidden in the screen with the clear menu
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television it's difficult
skip that because that's all the news flash and teletext only for tv
consequences on the marketing a part you don't have to design
product should reach a new market which is the customers below forty
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information
people of sixteen to forty is it from twenty to forty
lunch break and then we can work for thirty minutes
state of the save automatically in the project folder the teletext
overrides the previous and previous
overview of what we discussed in our last Meeting
