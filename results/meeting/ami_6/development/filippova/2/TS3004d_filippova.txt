decided so In the channel buttons there's a little colour
back lights and the background lights up also not the buttons
press it once the colour should switch to press again the colours
wood rubber buttons mute buttons are together and at the place to use we are used to find
speech buttons speech you try to sell it counts redesign
basic colours very at twelve twelve The basic colours
playstation or or dvd player that function and on off function text functions
Special colour you can skip this one because it's all quite normal
mail a menu
Slide no but it's quite use for a remote control
text next to the scroll wheel and the slide you miss
switch back to normal that teletext you just switch teletext
function i use daily and it's not on the basic functions
colour and transparent
underneath you can slide up and you cannot on the functions
hard plastic is that the allows us to use that would be buttons non rubber buttons
pay attention to that second layer that's the main function
style button you might as do it in normal computer
litre true Check the time to design that's the slides
time that was in big problem
press the criteria from one to zero we should we leave
basic colours are black or green or yellow light do that yellow light
fancy if you can make a prototype of this because we don't have any sizes
search for a page seven hundred to the television back to texas
back later the foreign you're taking that from ipods or a particular device
easy to use but the second layer is not easy
kinda weird a we get this information at the wrong time
mention because recharges not on the list and a less than an easy to use because east
beautiful is really subjective for because it has to do lots with the colours
switch to the your scores playstation this utterance to use pretty
choose green the blue and red
turn teletext on you set the seven hundred and you'd turn it off then the next and turn it on it still stays
save it on the same thing it's a map are still the ones in the project a map
Warning finish meeting that one was pretty hard
hour to work with is worked really just not worth
direction because it's twelve point three euros then we would discourage
add it from just with a mouse way setting
fancy look-and-feel and that's what the tracks the young audience
roll second level wanna say all the options that are still left
leave you can give it a number and then we can give herself an average four hour
regular chip think and a sample speaker is very small dollars
marketing said things and then we have to include a home station
marc for innovative that's more innovative
simply a square with round shapes not a round corners
follow the latest trends i the my computer
research about the comp the users
specification of that but imagine that you have to temperature voice
knew that before we could have and discussion really us really quicker
mistakes because the walls are thick
picked the lcd screen
