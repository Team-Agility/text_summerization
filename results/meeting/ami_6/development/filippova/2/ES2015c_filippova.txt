raised up buttons So you can feel
parts maybe transparent around the buttons or just the push button
test will have to look at how the remote control
choice of buttons what functions will show
buttons are you don't necessarily need to have it on remote
real something that you granny would want a remote control
change the buttons when you change in the face it's generated
meeting conceptual design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic and the casing is rubber
remote control would be cheaper design an hour more user interface
command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television
working this have to shake it a bit and revitalise
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates
stick graphical user you must need some presentation for the graphics like an lcd
interface to make it more trendy and we still have the money
ousted a kinetic energy then you can store the energy
colour it's face could have its own colour of button
lots of different possibilities for the energy is a new idea
numbers of the channels volume and you cannot any power
end so more internal casing and the rubber case which we pulled aside and rubber
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
Screen settings was use zero point eight times an hour
strip it down to like really basic shape
important aspect is that the remote control should be easy
meeting again in thirty minutes to finish our meeting we talked about our favourite animals
regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
weapon for the simple the weight that was the advanced chip
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television
rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
include good like ten to earlier there are these different options
happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg eating
keyboard so the numbers are like a keyboard you pressing
source is not necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange to we speak rating
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
flat then i got like on a cell phone a mobile phone so called a flat
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentations
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
method was mainly web-based research this time around i also spoke
looked at the design reports from previous years here real remote
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real
audio settings mono stereo pitch
information We need to start making some more specific decisions
