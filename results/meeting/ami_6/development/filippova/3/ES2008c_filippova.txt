cost we should just go for push buttons but i'm it intrigued
important features for a remote is seen a menu then we can scroll
press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
lots of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons
television send information back to the remote control list
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control
button to switch off in case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic
thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll an actual i got ipods scroll button
buttons to select your favourite channels and the volume control could double
main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons
watching tv in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons
simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip
lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
menu like contrast and tuning the vcr i've understood you could rather than menu
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel
idea of the kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches
solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
advantages and disadvantages if you have an lcd display would have to be quite small
model is a going to be for user interaction with this device
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case it can have any titanium
shaped like a vegetable or like i don't like a carrot source
main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
concept of the user interface and we'll come back to the chip
minutes a new type things you look and feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
sit there and stand control the television and be controlled through the device
specific functions to keep the remote from getting lost a large buttons for the essential functions a possibility for extra functions and the more advanced features
switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
examine each element separately but we're designing
covered with the latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
tv if you're changing the brightness on trying to see it happening
end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
find a way to protect like the chip
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on how should report are produced
fickle a or latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
fashion and simplicity and easy to use is necessarily the right drinking personally
opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
sending it out's only fourteen twenty
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
trendwatch market research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
start looking like Was group it is a hoax who can afford
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
attend a certain amount of space program
saved it this in the shared project
