watchers but remote control for double functions maybe buttons like that and to control that's lcd
spongy material is very irritating for the remote control with a base
components of remote control the case the properties of material we have to choose
fruits and vegetables it has to be colourful
colours are you are many colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour
colour lcd screen and it's very special a very trendy to have a remote control
case you must use or rubber the buttons to that the rubber
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
idea is that a good idea we have already mentioned all arguments
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station
buttons and it should and the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
possibility i i looked upon was the lcd display fits in that emission
idea of maybe at that came kind type of body weight and then with plastic colouration rounded
properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material like a hard plastic
open the conceptual design for a greater resemblance but with new with new colours
functional to indicate which what a device you are controlling test
technical part and the material and then you're gonna have like to material lines
transfer and plastic is the best with rubber of wood or titanium
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people dark
basic idea to use the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights
pictures of fruit and vegetables And spongy material I found this image
thousand and four you can't put something on the market really likes
email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility to put a scroll button
logo our base station is also off the shelf also the speaker
decided to use only basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
start with the technical things we have to discuss
sell will need to bring one line of tvs which we were planning
part of it and then you get a very large lcd screen
tv guide only for the channel with that we were for programs
breaks it's not very solid two and the material is soft rubber
resemble some piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease
mute and the teletext and the menu nowadays to access the screen settings
save a perhaps a some tiny buttons aren't user-friendly then we wouldn't can implement
simple electronic all chip is available with the led transmission or a transmitter
back began a resolution with it the goal is backs and colours
Drawl really nicely of the best we can put the logo and all that back
easy for you to read the minutes left my know how many colours
important because it has to be flash a bit and that is a an doesn't have to be in weighing day
trendy too because that's the mode it it's a it's icsi a extent
tv has to send information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
base things we'll read discuss the know fees
fruit is a yellow and black and white that's on the old grey
top and when you have a table for more than two weeks she just gets annoying because it still be too flashy
fond of of fronts like we can use on the telephone
skip the house as easy
nineties maybe what we're up to write from to this point
emission know it's like more phone row ball and it adds
switch from softer works it's also too much to the lawn wanna spend
coverage when you go to the living room
