Basic remote control from our plastic
remote controls as good morning remote control very often on the ground
document be sent to the station of the remote control and the recharger
basic buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons
pretty standard these rubber buttons are wish there should be on top
switch channel up button is like you switch channel up and down button
back that you'll get the button you knew a lot more like the that meant that and they three player
volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake
current controllers are all black and plastic it's that our problem
drop it you wanna change the volume only if you use your finger
difference if you put this this switch channels on side of it on top
modern remote controls the buttons are part so focuses on these two parts
important aspect is that you must make it fancy and it looks original
volume and top down is more with the channel it's on the bottom
cheap and it's easy to know me for a push to the yup

deciding yellow and it did the top and black and yellow the world
sense if you put it somewhere in the chances the beautiful scroll
recognition We i don't think we should put it on top band

personal thing is that we should go more modern look and d player
receive any information on speech recognition
divide you have to round it on the button and of skip
display requires an advanced chip can be a simple a regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced
room no just battery context like normal batteries just a rechargeable batteries expense
product you by your get one and more basic or you can choose
shape should be curved So round shapes not nothing square
original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod the cell
de curved is like front to the back and three d curves
design so i did some searching on the internet
low if we will a lot of room to put in as logo
strange that i receive Information about the cost but just a about the chip
tad next aspect also in contrast to last year the feel of material suspect it is expected to be spongy
zapping is the highest priority
clothes shoes the ta
people that want to spend money on something that's similar to a cheaper
show you the And i the the menu to that what's it called
target group we talk about was young and trendy
