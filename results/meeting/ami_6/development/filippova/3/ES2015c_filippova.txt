raised up buttons So you can feel
back so i had so many buttons or just the push button
research into the different components that we could use what's available to us to actually make the remote control test
choice of buttons what functions will show
buttons are you don't necessarily need to have it on remote for more simplistic style
back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control
phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons
meeting conceptual design more than you don't have to use individual buttons
discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic and the casing is rubber
complicated and the controls would be more user interface design so those are the trendy
command interface requires you to type text role commands and input data
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television that people have in the kitchen
working how we will be working on the look and feel design
worked hard for the personal face plates are busily to keep in mind
stick graphical user you must need some presentation for the graphics like an lcd
interface to make it more trendy and we still have the money
fully kinetic energy is transformed into a power to make a circuit
buttons so one same colour just to keep it to the simplest o'clock
kinetic energy source idea that's been used by some watches and that devices where you just shake in the device and it gives it to power
numbers of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power
end so more internal casing and the rubber case which we pulled aside and rubber
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
silly if we do point to have anything else just have to not important
strip it down to like really basic shape
important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be easy
meeting again in thirty minutes to finish our meeting we talked about our favourite animals
regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
advanced chip which will probably decide whether we buy a simple regular advanced
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television set
difficult if it's a rubber plate going on top or would stay
circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
include good like ten to earlier there are these different options
fruits and vegetables is the only Area that i find rather jarring
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
source is not necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
simplified Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange to we speak rating
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
flat then i got like on a cell phone a mobile phone so called a flat
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentations
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
looked at the design reports from previous years here real remote
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real
audio settings mono stereo pitch
information We need to start making some more specific decisions
