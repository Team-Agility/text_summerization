pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
decision on the remote control a lot of people we'll i dropped remote control on a break
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
main you can fit the lcd screen it right and you can draw
button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons
hand there and then you want touch the screen
important thing people like to last year was that the remote control should be look fancy
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes colours Material
important position the people can see it because it is the unique
rubber the total piece of rubber is still the rubber isn't fancy
fat people would effect thinking of press three buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button
colours it was the slogan and the corporate colour than a shape
touch options that so then we have an example of And then you should get the other options
arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
screen they don't need that big difference between young people fresh exciting and all people
shapes it is something between the square shape sit around got on the round
called cults settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu
young people they liked fruity colours And a two colours like red yellow
simple
round shapes As soft with the materials like the rubber or soft
sound and the channel buttons won't get that small when a cds green
cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
remote control has no way or in the settings menu for button channel volume selection
remembered and menu to go back it's a big button go back
people like a plain normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
user interface are also some questions about the concepts you have some ideas
recharge through docking station so that's charges
change a scroll with the menu to look up some some channels on your television
colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
easy way to a program that you say record into the device into the speaker
chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip
chargeable with an option for mount station
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium
soft but if you should the feelings spongy use of sponge bob like face
point we already decided that on the previous meeting and busy writing
bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
schools it is in the actual design
find something in the middle ground that square and round corners put a little in the middle
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty
sense that it you ask you give a question so the device
bigger for microphone for the speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
time we have forty minutes or thirty minutes of forty minutes of use Nx
elaborate something today we once again have a three presentations at home
Team member This presentation is once again or at least an agenda
lay flat down on table
