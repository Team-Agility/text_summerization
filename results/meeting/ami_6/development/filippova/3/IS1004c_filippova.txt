control a thing which a user should it should be already p define
find of the remote control starts beeping this is a way of finding the remote
technology we need to the remote control Many many colours remind some visitor
remote control to be the shape of a fruit which is handy
button but going to know every design should have at a button if you press
speak lost control
solution whole we can have some cheap like that on the remote control
remote control so i was all the idea that we can have to power supply
list and scroll buttons which are already available with us and the company
build you could link the recognition on a certain phrase to some function on the remote control
end of the banana if you could have the colour of a banana
powerful are powered by a man though it's a button on the fruit
suggested that we have some wheels to control the volume and channel
buttons are in the fit of shape of banana if you want to point
bite the things that by nine that and the base station control
design for a coffee machine that that with producing is you can say good morning
concentrating on like a fruit or you want to some like fruit logo
rising is a factor for us that so we'll go for the regular chip in banana
speech recognition is even if we can do it it's not really appropriate for a television and running
plastic as a thing is that most appropriate one it'll ring the cost
design and you have to work on the user interface
received an email i'll and lunchtime they know that the bring in mind to the technology division has developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker
people would find out what's it even if it wasn't a recharging station even if they didn't have to buy batteries
Twenty five twelve point without worrying too much about how to develop
banana you can you hold it like this and have the scroll wheel on top
scroll past television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations
mind with the actual physical design as to keep the speaker personal
decided not to go for speech recognition technology just because of some reasons and all honesty
fits in the hand and you had a lot of so phase two The for the controls
beep or people are more the devastating never find a fancy look and feel down in the technology gonna be know in innovation
extra for the functionality is such as the wheels the speaker you need so that in on the list but the device
technology lcd has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out so it's the basic
feel so old now More more core aspect not more hard core that aspect rather than a devise ways to many phones times on many buttons
volume up volume is it's it's very handy or as compared to the setting
opinion we should for goes on young people easy to use device
pushbuttons the traditional uses we can have the pushbuttons so that they don't feel
combination just to train it's not the law and channel four hundred channels
spend but charge idea of a banana but without looking completely Teach
clarify this these questions that they had in the meeting a few minutes
car and The car and train which was for the functional look and feel
recognise it can be like a match on on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back
break so you'd have to worry too much about the case been broken
work together to mall the first of first prototype is but actually integrated
additional it will be might be having slightly better market
sense that you can recognise a set not like a freight you train
materials like wood be done in and all those things but plastic
sold Each of you have some presentations just to draw some sketch
target a very high means fifty million euros is that profit
set it that's a switch with the double curve would actually menu
microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big
