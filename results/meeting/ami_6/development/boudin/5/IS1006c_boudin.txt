remote control we should be easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone
asked real people who are using real remote controlled every day and or any other to me that you see that the remote controls going to the smart
general people change tv more often than batteries on their remote control
simple buttons and speech recognition technology
pretty we don't have guns we speech recognition and it's cheap or a remote controls and speech again The room
speech recognition technology we take at least five euros or that you put some control we want to reduce
futuristic hear it would control with angles and the titanium back and not to look at a new remote controls it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a i'll put that says creaky what they are actions
distinctive look and feel and you look they do Which people use need to the trains if we were in the world as our company
integrate some into our remote control something like a light kills a lcd screen was different colours
expensive since we want to port some other features that speech recognition you want the radios
simple to program where the chip technology and it's more expensive
colours of like fruits and vegetables and spongy
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and batteries for Really like batteries and we will good price
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology inside
market of remote controls they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention
location and these people are really interesting on those features or they really like They're more want these fancy features
Generally add developed quite a broad concept of the interface but for Possible instruction or users many all and so all that complex saying so it's come together with your tv and remote controls
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser but we want to goals speaker independent or speaker dependent
flat different colours Depending on what is around like what colours around and depending on the temperature
technology and so that we can have Enough space or enough money too bad These And the shapes and then they can have different assembly
mark the user interface design
straight on these individual action g which are for them ram out a bit design meeting in thirty minutes
choose that titanium smelling like fruit or do we make spongy
chip do we have only the plastic or that cd five or A chip
important thing it has to be fancy have to have a fancy look-and-feel and then interestingly
touchpad it just a display for the tv you information
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
story that for the point before why not the rubber aspect might be important
solar cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy would solar cells hand too late to just use simple battery
chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive they feel is colour lcd
end we find out that it's not feasible in terms of sponginess
selling point maybe it has to be the base
bone shape it has to be more wrong than the More roo look natural
follow smart should be some not too complicated
problem is that this design we phone that we can't use the double record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
big and there's so i'm just asking them the current trends according to them when the going to store is that when they asked there are friends mine has this and that euros And finally
decision we want to take on this meeting are on the them first and component concept so what energy we use what chip on print and one cat case
criterion the trends that we seen big cities like paris and milan it seems that this year think it should have a fruit and vegetable
remember has a nokia phone we can use the phone as a good to Example of work to it beeps back
dark blue who are watching the trends there inventing it You're creating the trend i hope
interface there to use pushbuttons or you could just read it cd display would only be displayed and not a touch sensitive
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
red goes faster than the life
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
body one call really come up with our forties
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that mark and then sandy
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning
puts lots of concentrate
