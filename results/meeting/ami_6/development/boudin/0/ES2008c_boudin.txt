push buttons would recharge the battery
menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
user remotes you press the buttons are fun
lots of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
matter how many buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting
television send information back to the remote control list
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the remote control
button to switch off in case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery
ipods and things right now have touch scroll buttons
buttons changing the volume favourite channels is applicable
buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main ones being like and lemons or stripe
people when i watch tv in the dark
simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip depending
lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
ri uses for buttons to me to move around so range of settings so on a small lcd screen then back up at your tv and people
menu like contrast and tuning the vcr i've understood you could rather than menu
information i have no idea of the scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
idea of the kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches
solar battery although there are slight complications with solar battery
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
model is a going to be for user interaction with this device this is an ipod from apple
shaped like a mobile phone so you hold
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
changeable covers like for your mobile in different fruit and vegetable colours we could colour
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
concept of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface list of device
minutes a new type things you look and feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
point having a television and be controlled through the device
international be on we said but for all age groups different functions to keep the remote from getting lost a large buttons for the essential functions a possibility for extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
fun doing it components design ri
spongy latex it's a spongy is the end
features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
worried about protecting the circuit board
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
hit my understanding of old latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
fifty minutes left of the meeting
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
work together on a prototype using modelling clay
designer of our real reaction company wind focus on fashion in technological elements we can add in the word latex titanium or rubber or other coloured types of plastic
armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
sending it out's only fourteen twenty
simple regular advanced chip-on-print as that machine prince on the wires and source
trendwatch market research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford
mind that these are the options that we have for manufacturing
attend a certain amount of space program
saved it this in the shared project
