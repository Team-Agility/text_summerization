buttons connected the buttons
design we can make a design for those only those buttons
easy to find your remote control
important thing for people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control and the advanced remote controls so we might want to build in the future to support them Some audio signal like one phones
power buttons and use one time and the volume
top goal of this meeting is to reach decision on the product on the target group and the functions of the remote control button remote control function of remote
video sets and and there's a special button that find the remote control button you press it and your tv set starts to make a weights out and your remote controls
user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control with the last possibilities a great feeling in touching the buttons
function and the problem to programme button or change the channel switching
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to change the channel
remotes are reports it we give back to the user interface designer
device can have communicate with almost every tv set
round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
channel selection is the most important or volume selection and the teletext
buttons for the advanced other Functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all functions available device
important button And there are lots of people do not use all the extra features
multi function the technical design or energy save design we should really implement
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip set a circuit boards
cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board
opinion the it be easy ease of equipment but it's quite elaborate
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
cheap to incorporate integrated circuit board will become much more user if we do in that do not implement these buttons you have that's the cheaper that the chip
total design of this piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions
focus on customers are the younger people
user interface connect to chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
drop the voice recognition the data
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find the one solution
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume and the programme one and some fancy lights
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound from other sounds
find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness
hebrew i bet devices which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
hope personal coach is we'll assist
specially designs and energy friendly components concept
main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques
move the stick to to a position maybe light
generates messages using infrared light to the tv set
thirty minutes of time to perform are individual work for ball When it's fun
part is forty percent of the market
market will Examples will change adapt
watching a movie it would can see beep
home station for base station next a tv is a bus with nancy
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product that is really what the market
dark concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
disadvantages that there are so concerns about the costs and things like that battery lifetime energy saving another advantage
user-friendly as you feel fifties
minutes made the project documents folder
slight problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
