watchers but remote control for double functions maybe buttons like that and to control that's lcd
lawn wanna spend more money on the remote control with a base
components of remote control the case the properties of material we have to choose
fruits and vegetables it has to be colourful
colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour look like it the plastic mold is in one colour and thus those cushion pets around it are in another colour set
colour lcd screen and it's very special a very trendy to have a remote control
telling me that when we build a remote control of of plastic or rubber the buttons to that the rubber double curved case is is it a three dimensional curve in the design
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
control if that's a good idea of maybe is a little bit Too much for twelve and a half Abduction
week with the lcd and the docking station we can make our logo
numbers to power button skip the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
mode after the trailers of lcd display on that we do lots of information
idea of maybe at that came kind type of body weight and then with plastic colouration rounded
properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material like a hard plastic
open the conceptual design for a greater resemblance but with new with new colours
functional to indicate which what a device you are controlling test
technical part and the material and then you're gonna have like to material lines
transfer and plastic is the best with rubber of wood or titanium
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people dark colours simple recognisable shapes
basic idea you got we're probably gonna have like to type of materials like the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights we have to incorporate slides
year are surprisingly fruits and vegetables And spongy material I found this image
thousand and four you can't put something on the market which is on the ground
email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility for the remote control
base station is also off the shelf also the speaker
puts an extra x and on the simplicity of our remotes to make these two most basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
start with the technical things we have to discuss
reaches a different marked but it doesn't cost really much effort to bring one line with the dark colour
sell and then tie a title for programme or at least at a quite large part of the rc The up and the upper part or whatever it's it's not use wood buttons
tv guide only for the channel with that we were for programs
buttons has to be solid two and the material is soft rubber for falling and it feels
design already resemble some piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity thing is just the shape should be for today this is fruit just round curves
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease
time you would have teletext and the menu most tvs
spongy thing already comes for in the in the cushions pets and things on this side
easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple electronic all chip is available with the led transmission or a transmitter
back to the costs again but we get a bill but pretty cheap design to see if they within our limits of twenty five euros
Drawl really nicely of the best we can put the logo
part of the minutes are very hard to read because there are two documents that one layer
colours is very important because it has to be flash a bit and that is a an doesn't have to be in weighing day when you're gonna something's
trendy too because that's the mode it it's a it's icsi a extent
ia is still don't have any information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
base things we'll read discuss the know fees
fruit is a yellow real young men and then make styles
top and when you have a table for more than two weeks she just gets annoying because it still be too flashy
fond of of fronts like we can use on the telephone
skip the house as easy
nineties maybe what we're up to write from to this point
emission know it's like more phone row ball and it adds
warm use my pen anymore so be it just ordinary keyboard
coverage when you go to the living room
