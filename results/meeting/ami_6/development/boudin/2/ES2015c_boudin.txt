raised up buttons So you can feel
research team of phones and in new multiple all options scroll buttons on and the shape was so some that's that are be pressing like a volume but instead of that one button
research into the different components that we could use what's available to us to actually make the remote control test
cost of buttons what functions will show
buttons are you don't necessarily need to have it on remote for more simplistic style
sales plan to say and the remote control them all these patterns
phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons that actually that control controls that are behind the rubber
agenda for this so this particular meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design minutes to just black buttons
actual remote would be hard plastic with rubber can get on top
mind more design an hour more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons
command interface requires you to type text role commands that the user uses to control its operation and input at the keyboard so the numbers
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television that people have in the kitchen
Pop in tarot will have to work with rubber has already given the market
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates are busily to keep in mind
aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user interfaces to stick graphical
learn from mistakes of all are interface that can be too complicated for people
kinetic energy is transformed into a power to make a circuit
buttons so one same colour it's face could have its own colour of button
lots of different possibilities for the energy source idea that's been used by some watches and that devices where you just shake in the device and it gives it to power
numbers of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power would be some symbol
end so more internal casing is that would be were rubber encapsulate in all of these Chips and diodes and delicate technology
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
Screen settings was use zero point eight times an hour
strip it down to like really basic shape
important aspect is that the remote control should be easy
rubber from our kick-off meeting will be forty minutes will be meeting
regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
weapon for the simple the weight that was the advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house cat our dog
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television
rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
main internal feature it is a circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
include good like ten to earlier there are these different options
recent fashion update to have a quite a fashion watchers in paris and milan is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
keyboard so the numbers are like a keyboard you pressing
source is not necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting the interior lighting system
lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat then i got like on a cell phone a mobile phone so called a flat
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
lee back inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
personal coach will be the best of the information for it's a half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint in a trying call
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
method was mainly web-based research this time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
looked at the design reports from previous years here real remote
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real swimming or a store
audio settings mono stereo pitch
information We need to start making some more specific decisions
