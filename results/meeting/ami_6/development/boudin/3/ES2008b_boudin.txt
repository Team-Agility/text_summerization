sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control hear she expects the buttons to be in certain places
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls in the analysing
controlling most of the working design presentation i have a pet
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy into data
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled That extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function
sit at a drastic difference between those two remotes that have too many buttons on the remote all they want like an upgrade
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and that might be older people
people are so is that like change the channel but that sixty five percent terrain and our views
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
people are only using ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote and that ties
industrial design if you're components concept user interface is for this product
contrary to what people maybe people who have problems with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
team make a schematic of the way that the energy source people
age so younger people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
audio setting is then given it much important and visibility on the remote as a minute channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel settings
desire for voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
wind One large accessible buttons for the essential
control in this index opinions on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or focused
type numbers but you before the next meeting in terms of users
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work or infrared bulb which will then bring
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
components that we find here are the energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip transmitting information to the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find a balance between features and price
deadline the target group that means that is very few we need to each group
bring the data to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
instruction manual it comes at the end that's and hot because of the combination
thirty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting on them in the shared folder
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics
price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
number to make it technologically the end of select other than just media but code
short amount of time you get specific in crap instructions from your personal coach emailed
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
prominent as the main features and price as you mentioned something called rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
settings adjust brightness
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range of ages
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
companies like apple have you might lot of progress
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
