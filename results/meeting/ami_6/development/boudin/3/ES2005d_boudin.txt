product miss all the user requirements or not this product and end
companies a lot of their products in the shape of fruits to give a range of products so they of shaped
buttons would be like individual users
idea but evaluation line in additional do all of our product
design it may be a meeting all the requirements of the customers like it technology wise price
shift button maybe start
shaped like a way see look at this as think of is to operate a given radio
type non at the buttons one was in a few buttons you can flip the redness
mind that the specifications are we had to frame vegetables are quite popular and that people like something that is good to look at it and not many buttons
pushbuttons and the scroll buttons and it's gonna cost is for doing point six euros
save so says our product we use all these requirements i would also prefer to be rate rank
company strategy so i would go for a one as we know only get to it but we were limited
providing quality products not only incorporating latest technology is but also in terms of writing in my mind turns
technology it's got the latest trends in speech technology
marketing strategy of the company is quite rare bird in the market
Basic requirements part of the pro of the project and i will say is quite simple and quite handy
user requirement is essentially just to operate a tv
views on the basis of design was she was a very interface expert radio
project evaluation we have on the crap out here is fifty Project
buy tv maybe the company name on the front which is a little black a line in the middle
product me steve to face or terms of the market
parts and then like a banana out all and you are limiting
fair share data shows that people like everything else everything that is being advertised like those shows and everything is being able to it in the form of fruit and veggie they were all getting them some as it is or showing some association
hold on to find a shift button
speak into that like little ball to talk it's speak quite mission
entering the evaluation criteria meeting with seven point scale
hand because we already stated that people do graph of fashionable things nowadays
trendy to some i'm just not small and the fruit good to look at the like school
traditional remote control conforms to the company strategy is that the question
single curved would be if it was that someone curve on both sides
end times leds as but if a latest fashion trend
ideas like glow in the dark like that we discussed
order to say even are two euros i was thinking That we could have a sense of the same shape but just have a flat
scroll once we still could be channel up and down and volume
electronics it's not always quite say you don't always have so many choices is with talk about are bonuses and the races
curvature rest like there is case giving only one or two traces we are leaving limiting all customers and by limiting them the olympic i would say the same thing over profit
material da will tell you can work this is we're going to discuss
keeping it keeping in mind all the safety issues
holiday pay maybe in order
click back and that bottom right so we're starting from when you see arrow keys
bigger so we might be more space for the slogan on the front
simple that's the charging base prongs of the boss
yellow orange and it powered
eat any proper goes a week or they use these are just rubber
white board you brian
main problem that we have one for sleep being the finance
induce more television watching this poster
raised out and then i feel free
wall or forgotten familiar the minutes
stories the powerpoint i I was that was a phone
