buttons connected the buttons
design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find first before you can find your remote control
important thing for people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control and the advanced remote control
power buttons and use one time and the volume
top goal of this meeting is to reach decision on the product on the target group and the functions of the remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote controls the multi function
video sets and and there's a special button that find the remote control button you press it and your tv set starts to make a weights out and your remote
user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control with the last possibilities a great feeling in touching the buttons
push a button or switch to to channels when you have something and channel four n something on channel switching
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to change the channel
functions and the money that we can say from that we should use for having a design and thinking about the user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
control the tv set would have such a device you would have to walk you tv
easier way of a round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
channel selection is the most important or volume selection and the teletext
list of Functions do you want an explicit list which include all function available device
important button And there are lots of people do not always want to use the voice
decided to implement this a function and can be implemented in in our design will become more complicated
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip set a circuit boards
production cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost by not implementing a lot of function
buttons like that which are easy to use we my coat rack
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques
wise board will become much more user if we do in that do not implement these buttons you have that's the cheaper that the chip or in one of the circuit boards
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
user interface connect to chip which is connected to the sender which generates
problem is it but it depends on the decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition the data
keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find the finding function
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume and the programme one and some fancy lighting and techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
separate the clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound from other sounds
market is interested in some advanced techniques and the user friendliness
cell phone just one like in the device which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten digits but keep the program
buy personally we should infer use infrared
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components
expensive and they're hard to implement fancy techniques
goal was a boston move you would like to start
easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set
generates a few times within that a certain period of time to perform are individual work i have no time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
younger part is forty percent of the market
older you might want to constrain that portion market would respond to a simple
watching a movie it would can see beep
home station for base station next to see this a little antenna
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product that is really what the market
summary of all things are spoken and the different concept we discuss is already in this in the previous discussion
disadvantages that there are so concerns about the costs and things like that battery life to the batteries
user-friendly as you feel fifties
seconds i received some new project documents folder
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
case we have to metal contacts
