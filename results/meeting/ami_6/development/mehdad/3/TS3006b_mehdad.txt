easier to integrate several functions in one button it gets confusing
easy so for just a zapping around channels you can just push one button and one navigation button
menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
design the basic function menu screen it's more about the functions are are going to to be on the screen is to reduce the size
showed up put the the extra advanced options all model to the on screen display
time you have one button in the middle of it says menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu in the lcd screen
basic function if you are going to use the advanced options are going to press to the menu device
button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option we want to put an lcd screen
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional functionality
wary of space left and then put a logo should be like on top which function is that we have left
navigate the channels and left or right for the volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons
figure or figure out a way to do that easily press the sounds when you press a button and the teacher a goes It it sends a signal to a chip which are translates
concentrate more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen is below and the buttons are in the middle
channel settings or channel five and phone account channel anything you want to move the only kind to channel
power button but that's present channel volume selection are teletext
simple functions for the whole public and the advanced one but a lot of options for the younger people who are more experience
time to learn how to use a new remote control if you can control the steps settings if you do is like a very and now base you need to change
user interface designer can design menu For all these functions
hard to to just do it all on your remote to program the channel programming
prefer we use the basic options and lcd options that's communicate with the infrared decoder
features the above forty people are not so interests and to not interested in the screen and the speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
room that's it's actually a part of your interior of off you're designing your room
corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote
confirm a want to go one step back to it to upper level which twos and focus
problem mean you are you a car and channel number do you want to save
idea because then it becomes clear about the extra two buttons or active
reach a little bit for the power cable when you go back
tvs automatically display the name which you get to the cable
match the operating behaviour of the users are not afraid of a lot of functions or make the buttons as user-friendly
functions and on the Seems was it the target that's a group of forty
microphone it can be very small if you look at your mobile
elderly people don't understand it so so they need a simpler remote like this if you put it on the top and then make the corporate logo
needed to integrate those sound an An image options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble on base
television itself is also the option that brightness and screen colour etcetera
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
threw it at transformer it's the signal gets a boost that and then sent to the tv on the tv and that if you will Translated into a function
problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway and lots of the times there is a brand present
clear distinction between age groups concerning the features but we just have to build them in because they find
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television with that usually three buttons and very hard
skip that because that's all the news flash and teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
additional process or and also for part you don't have to design
product should reach a new market which is the customers below forty
spend a lot of time thinking about what i was gonna do and then a couple minutes before this i get my fun to the information that i need so frustrating
people of sixteen to twenty five to thirty five to forty years of thirty
