research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote comes in the remote control Being one or beyond thing and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition
extra internet connection to use a remote see that see a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special
time corporate to do with the remote control you start and then you stop
focusing on tv but still like a universal remote in that as a replacement remote control can bring out menus on but our company's tvs
mortal which is to be trained and being a micro control to say to turn the volume up because i can't hear very i don't really want you'd run out what people are saying by talking one on one instead of pressing up on the remote control unit
remote as one bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote controls are used by more than one person's And as you targeting single people
requirements i'd give it a marketing report is to tv remote court
scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons
bring new technologies for young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
prototypes for right and left handed people are what it about the shape of the remote control
people want to be l to find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech recognition gets in the way more than that helps
point because actually having all that some of the remotes out there this is quite although our price
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen you just scroll for that program rubber band to a channel
channels that you two digit numbers and you have to press a special button is important but also it the number of buttons
channel than a one i what i use a remote control does is it just change that change the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big difference Between the them the first know base unit they can also receive signals of wills the television where you can say change the lighting in the room and that cords out of stand-by then for a device to the receiver
working design is so user interface
top of the could be a speech recognition system as a wide and really quite a microphone also to be sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find
mobile phones are you don't use you don't remember people's fun be you remember the name and you're fine and then so this would be pretty a pretty wide range of remote controls on ep means talk on which is a customer know written review side
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
natural that we have a product to really that work it does work was supposed to work on and so on the working on television remote that was universal is that they have a lcd screens
add deviated is a tv you can have a lot of these background noise in the tv that we can work with and grab information
simple there's only a few buttons but what each of those buttons does something different in a different context
feeling is that it's Rick regarding costs digits we have and target cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euro because for twenty five euro we can really do with that but the very basic remote control
cd screen which helps when you using multiple devices i suppose because you can have multiple functions which have a couple of the round buttons down to a minimum but not quite that interfere with the functionality of the device
relation to know you would be cheaper than the lcd and speech record
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons that they're the People it is and on top
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press the press the button to talk and the tvt v set
functional requirements and especially for the For the user requirements like a big courting all those things are required and for wise
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel could be used without lcd screen just for changing channel numbers easily
programme you could have a start time but on the On the chip
la is that the court is sitting similarly there are different interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology switch at existing
idea but as a marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition
seoul extend past the hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should be similar to the traditional
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting you have the task you have to work
teletext but we want to get read one of four requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
master a very easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
focus more on the internet aspects because you see the text is outdated
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
question is to you open about this cd
forces you had a company which is putting the fashion in electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
selling the potential of the device in use a potentially you can then do a look like change the lights and i close the windows what about the heating
opinion there My and all these mine though shouldn't be bit smaller
eds they're more like and they good idea is to it looks like a year
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting the green one and it can watch
english it sounds like them and school you know men
