remote control market so we found that people will people do have preference for a those fancy more one of the remote control switch look and feel a vote
people want like if somebody wanted in banana shaped we will put that case we want to that war waveform
easy to like at the different shape and up in a in this button buttons in translates into the sequence of courses that it then sends the amplifier
include either with the rid of it some remotes and we give something new technology got are the ones where and as as new design the outlook we really need the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market
pointing out that this one the volume it is pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape realistic banana shape giving want to that so it will give a banana shape
survey findings was that they want to easy to use a i'm not about the lcd
shape i quite like the design of that because that could sit
market survey we have seen that people are we doing to be able to but they want the choir
idea to you then i will these table so she was then people use mile mice mouse is now with the scrolling
technologically innovative like glow in the dark or speech recognition system
fashions this and fashion the holidays and fashion update shows that fruit and veggie there was a people
factor of this vector it is twice as important as the side so the third factor in others are in our market means and take in designing our our remote controls
opposite what does it make the on the upper side you get the fashion on the other side with the microphones so you can place it face time
user interface where you have cops buttons and you point to it rather than having the output is a stream of text
specifically as voice activated
comfortable to hold it if it's gonna be voice recognition
people have a later date clothes shoes and furniture everything that fruit or five or a fruit bowl from the telly
software for the same recognition setting would actually going for speech thing you said are take now our research and development department came up with some breakthrough
spongy latex latex as a kinda spongy feel of the material is expected to be spongy the other than just having a plastic look a hard
meeting in half an hour glass half of what we need not to have a full colour we will just have a half of colour
oval double curved send it to me if we're talking about three or can we can easy
features we had the fancy chip we need to buy input from the buttons
idea but for but and for the thing we tried before easy because there will be on lcd c display in the room a different friend i you can just critical whatever the war
basis of like reading room of battery will be a good idea but then they have to keep them and they are more whites outside the solar energy
cover the rubber all the plastic casing this email i got from our manufacturing team
scroll it and then when you reach the a menu item that you require you pressed the middle of a scroll wheel and speech recognition
pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow he would set the logo and the slogan running up one side
doubles as a standard parts and for using it as a recharging of also for using it as send recognition
work on giving me a model in clay
today to be they have got they are going crazy with the lcd technology this as a man we small and cheap
necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company colours the lemon wasn't that far I have it doesn't work
presume that the functions was come up on the tv screen

secure areas and i've seen a lot of them with the cover missing so like other hand like what it is portable phones whatever have that colour lcd screens
Mail to use the minutes of the last meeting i'm going to discuss what the trend watching
sends out the infrared light signal to the television writers
playing could be green or on and off as reds
open up there's a circuit board we have to use bc at the same setup processor
preference is just a imagination the race symbols everything but it's pointing
twenty five thirty five euros a cat or twelve years fifteen manufacturing
rl the data but it is good for have ten which is quite this for the one that we can begin
sit on a say in that and It's quite got a quite a steady pace
price and price not withstanding is it too complicated it's it can be too much just overloaded
automatically if you put in project documents is on the Test
promote any size we like or is there a minimum
instructions will be sent by your personal coaches
