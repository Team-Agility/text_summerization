findings is uses would be really interested in a look at the doing to find of the remote control
tv at the fancy thing that's true you can bring to we can bring to the remote control in the shape of a banana
remote control to be the shape of a fruit which is handy
bowl a job or button if you press the button there are that are more to start beeping so with the remote base that looks like a banana which few buttons with only a few buttons
speak lost control
solution whole we can have some cheap like that on the remote you do need my income for a remote buying
time more couple of some of the features of that potential funky looking remote control so i was all the idea that we can have to power supply
functionality is just a couple scroll-wheels not button it's hard to get so many button you can say skip i have channels if if i'm going from scrolling possible in united
build you could link the recognition on a certain phrase to some function on the remote control
hold like the way you the end of the banana you wanna of holders may you may be one of the whole like a gun know and you don't have to point toward the fall
powerful are powered by a man though it's a button on the fruit
important to have two scroll-wheels because you want one for the channel we also want one for the volume control and they need exposing these are the three scroll
difficult to make it steve like the texture of an hour anyway and take to have exact shape if you'd and not be out the door probably you may as do it in a style as way that just looks a bit more twenty first century route and sixties and seventies
bite the things that by nine that and the base what having an a base station is nothing more just it's that by which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket
conversation with the coffee machine that that with producing is you can say good morning how would you like a coffee
beginning of the fruit or you want to some like fruit but a different fruit for kids
rising is a factor for us that so we'll go for the regular chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana that advanced chip
worth but it doesn't really add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech since the since it's speech not really speech recognition is even if we can do it it's not really appropriate for a television and running
plastic as a thing is that most appropriate one it'll ring the cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production components
design and you have to work on the user interface
received an email i'll and lunchtime they know that the bring in mind to the technology division has developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit
user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries that rechargeable batteries so all the period of car find him to cut the cost future part
norway with with buttons i have to be at some point without worrying too much about how to develop
banana you can you hold it like this and have the scroll wheel on top
unique problem with television's is that if you have this got this scroll-wheel for the television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll and then just ways that station
soundtrack for the kid is the design so you'd have to record into the device every possible combination
decided not to go for speech recognition technology just because of some reasons and all honesty
fits in the hand and you had a lot of so phase two The for the controls
beep or people are more the devastating never find a fancy look and feel down in the technology gonna be know in innovation
basis a extra for the functionality is such as the wheels the speaker you need so that in on the list but the device like bci dvd players which are usually a touch with the tv
advanced technology lcd has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out so it's the basic

back to the minutes of the last meeting we should take a decision on that point
find more interesting more important needs a fancy look-and-feel instead of a instead of the car and The car and train which was for the functional look and feel
recognise it can be like a match on on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back the phrase in response
speaker is actually on the chip then if it's too far away from a the casing was the casing is too thick then you may not hear is concerned are we can have some gap so you'd have to worry too much about the case been broken is the inside
city's would not be possible to implement it for the next prototype is but actually integrated
additional it will be might be having slightly better market
real recognise i he was but he was in a set not like a freight you train it for a certain for a certain phrase
thin veneer of wood be done in and all those things but plastic you can have the book but the side not the materials we cannot that the book
ripple it's all the ideas we've had we had doing these presentations just to draw some sketch about so which would be the pro the final product and that were strip
decided that we can and spend twenty five euros is that profit
set it that's a switch with the double curve would actually menu and you could like drawer something on on the whiteboard
microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big deal
