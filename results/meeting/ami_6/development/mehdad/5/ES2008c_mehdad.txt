cost we should just go for push buttons which is what real reaction
menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
keeping a very small and simple set of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional button we have are in have like black with red sitting
television send information back to the remote control list
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the television be control for your remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
button to switch off in case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery
thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast
scroll through the channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons remain things but then i go back
tend to watch tv i them wanting to say on the tv and the button to switch
decided on like a simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip depending
lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
menu like contrast and tuning the vcr i've understood you could rather than menu
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery although there are slight complications with solar battery
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
model is a going to be for user interaction with this device this is an ipod from apple
titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone so you hold
double curved is like like two sides that curve gonna make one curve of a case we could do a flat which flat case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved case or it maybe even a double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
buttons could be shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours maybe free vegetable colours
quick to access the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time i am imagining
concept of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface and we'll come back to the chip
minutes a new type things you look and feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
sit there and stand control the television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
international be on we said but for all age groups different functions to keep the remote from getting lost a large buttons for the essential functions in the device and the extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts panel close
examine each element separately but we're designing
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text
suggestions that make is to aim is to include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
find a way to protect the circuit board
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
related to this but of latex cases that it's hard to cover with the latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look and feel and as these are range the top one is double important
replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work together on a prototype using modelling clay
designer of our real reaction company that i there are what we have to stress fashion watchers in paris and milan comments on some things that are gonna be go on this year
opening armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
sending it out's only fourteen twenty
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
moving on to market research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked
receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options that we have for manufacturing
attend a certain amount of space program
saved it this in the shared project
