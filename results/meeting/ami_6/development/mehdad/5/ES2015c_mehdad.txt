raised up buttons So you can feel
back so i had so many buttons on and the links was so some that's that are be pressing like a volume but instead of that one button
research into the different components that we could use what's available to us to actually make the remote control test
cost of buttons what functions will show
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
live up to our purpose of having a very fashionable remote control concept and how we're gonna make a what it really is and that thing the meeting
constructed in the same way as but the front cover mobile phone you can you take off the hard cover and then there's the makes it the buttons when you change in the face it's generated
agenda for this so this particular meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design on to this type of rubber
actual remote would be hard plastic and put it in rubber can get on top
complicated and the controls would be more user friendly remote control would be cheaper design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface consist of a quarter of buttons
decided that the command line interface requires you to type text role commands that the user uses to control its operation and input data
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television agree i if we can make a remote that will be universal
Pop in tarot will have to work off of them see how fashion to change it a bit and revitalise
wimp should see what the success of the first Face plates are busily to keep in mind
aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point device
explain what the user interface to make it more trendy and we still have the money
kinetic thing was stressed about lies it's instant energy is transformed into a power to make a circuit
buttons so one same colour it's face could have its own colour of button
lots of different possibilities for the energy source idea that's been used by some watches and that devices where you just shake in the device and it gives it to power
symbol of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power which we've been sitting inside a building
sie it's like at the same rubber coating which is on the casing is that would be were rubber encapsulate in all of these Chips and diodes and delicate technology
decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line
silly if we do point to have anything else just have to not important
strip it down to like really basic shape
important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be technologically innovative and hope
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting we talked about our favourite animals
called so it's a medium or regular chip was supposed to simple
separate apart from the chip which will probably decide whether we buy a simple the weight that was the advanced technology
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual components so we'd have to get it in separately
titanium is not to be possible in know it just to be on top budget
components of the circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at ed
concert a one point device that doesn't include good like ten to earlier there are these different options
recent fashion update to have a quite a fashion watchers in paris and milan is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
brings it thing we need to be recharged and the bulk the size
advanced would have to go with a lcd c Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
popular thing we came up out of your market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
pushing the light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat then i got like on a cell phone a mobile phone so called a flat
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty straight forward
lee back inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
personal coach will be the best of the information for it's a half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint i can't remember what it's got at the components
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
method was mainly web-based research this time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
looked at the design report from previous years here real remote
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real swimming or a store
audio settings mono stereo pitch
information We need to start making some more specific decisions
