sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control are a fairly standard this requirements when the users
web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote control
controlling most of the working design presentation i have a pet
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy going to the user
tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
talk about the technical functions design how the apparatus should have and the working designers figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
sit at a drastic number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote all they want like an upgrade
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design it's gonna be crucial
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and that might be older people
people are so is that like change the channel and changing the volume people
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
focusing on the designers people are only using ten percent of that they would be willing to pay more for a fee and see you're looking remote and that ties
suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different at the types of user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
appeals to younger people maybe people who have problem with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people don't wanna be changing
older people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicate like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel change the volume freeze frame
breaks i was given in terms of each was the voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
wind One large accessible buttons for the essential
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or adjust
type in the page number but you before the next meeting in terms of users
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied
combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work on each task a step
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
components that we find here are the energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data to the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data and presents a while without strips gathering
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver
talk about our functions and our target group that means that is very few we need to each group
bring the data to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
instruction manual it comes at the end that's and hot because of the combination
thirty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting on them in the shared folder
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
price limit of the twelve and a half euro to produce
analyse people's desires and needs focusing
number to make it technologically the state of technology
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary
prominent as the main features and price as you mentioned something called rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
settings adjust brightness
Switch the quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
companies like apple have you might lot of progress
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
