money working on screen menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing
play any text on the buttons like labels on the button at the chip very visible very big
buttons will be in special colour But that's important
ipod you just every time you wanna go back in the menu button on the on screen we don't have a teacher
's and we have our little menu button here if you push is normally they're the many buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push it was sent to the tv and stick
work relevant people
changing channel or that would be to changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle
shapes and then discussed of the buttons work together as a team the digital
corpora wanna know we could also have alternative colours not are not text but this is the general
hard to turn the machine of the time we had a lot of information and they're the same time
remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria
confusing but if we had all the buttons in black and a design and the outside and yellow that we're corpora
pictures of the different parts of the case that if it looks of the case out of college
talk about here it is it just evaluating how we create this project information we got a menus
break down the on the agenda that they produce the twelve point and i still the way i remember that i needed or for that point
answer every single curved case how many colours what the colours that's curved is pretty
difficult to just have an external device are used the scrolling up and down for a list of justice you find the choice that he wants and you press
tend to meetings and then people have a preference as far as feel and functionality
rate and the design it match that appropriate dave remember really we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons
mine it was like would you prefer an lcd screen or multi-function remote control
how'd you get back to the main menu or submenus and so how'd
functional is also a pretty hard to mess
opinion but if we're now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle aged me and customer might not want a free coloured remote
fashionable can you make a remote it's pretty in technology in fashion and so those are the mexicans
seconds then it brings you back and find it but anywhere also it's gonna stand up like this on your table if you want it to if i made about the bottom flat
people it doesn't volume saved up volume up and volume down on the other side
Project process That section with the room for creativity leadership teamwork means any new idea those are like if we had like a brainstorming period
lose i do think that on a scale of one to seven and how easy or hard was it two blues
order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit board in the chip because right gonna need a dash
people have like things you can put on the keys that you press it and it'll beep
decisive person's the top to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes from last meeting what we just discussed the war
war have the prototype you did you work together or did you like to separate projects
sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons including five research
buy and more market evaluation even just have it one set of source in a word
decisions what we need to do is first of all decide on the shape which are the three different shapes
designs to be used even in your left hand or on your right hand if it's made of latex crap appropriately take that into account
clear and the size of end down at the end of the meeting in rio do the job of making firm decisions
people should really base they're both sort fruit and vegetables in really good like creativity with the information
questionnaire to put down criticisms of But the process on the the final results
link i what the side i would just get slide subtitles
local i have never moving the battery that's expensive but we have a sample chip
distinctive that it's not just like another be the technology around your house
kinda going by the web page they didn't give me any clue year like yellow grey but on the slogan's and blue
minutes so that it will include all the agenda and all that fifteen
creating from the excel file that was a mike that option to do that and just take my own notes
son and the user wary net i know you're saying you're a little bit nervous about that i it's a remind
address the fact that it does need to have a corporate logo so let's make we keep that in mind your more knowledge management
pen was a little distracting for me personally
solve the gatekeeper grip to it doesn't ring finger for other hand
lightning bolt or not very cute
