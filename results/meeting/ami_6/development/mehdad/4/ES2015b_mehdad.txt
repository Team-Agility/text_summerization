back to respect the research
discuss with poppy how we can have a an alarm system so that people want gotta turn on the tv with the remote control
intention is to stick design we'll have more money t going to the design side

clock you have an lcd screen or a remote control would be that furthering that problem
statistics on the relevancy of each of the buttons think for people want gotta
