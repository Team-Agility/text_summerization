role is to design a television remote control
functional design is supposed to achieve
discussion i it is does any one of you would have experiences with remote control
specifications of user interface and it in but user interface design
conceptual design they will be individual
remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with its things you would like to change things would like to improve

Read different types of design we can be concerned
individual work week and then discussion

multifunctional a gadget do that with the control your house old machines
remote control which we use for tv it should it it should be used for for some of the pope was also like controlling the can't reach it inside that house on fire at condition us for heating system
case we have two in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard
role is the main responsibilities
worries or clapping that's not specific
people original trendy and user friendly
market range unlimited meeting international
opening acquaintance tool training try at the white board has to control
slow signal meeting just whether it's a beep or whether ally it store
buttons on a at or maybe clearly better market buttons
sensor it gets a certain darkness it has a sensor and it gives out a signal
betsy i'm the project manager for ti
project plan that falls and at the same heading
clue for that is that you would respond to a clap or a response to your voice or would respond what you'd you have to do to make it beep or blink
case we use and reuse them right every day
lost a signal was a bit slow signal
justify that was by having sufficient features to make it so that price
profit aim for the company is fifty million euro The market
production cost should not icsi hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro
piece that you will get specific key instructions for that that's the end
minutes any questions at this point
idea is maybe that's the main it really hit me in other words if it's like in a dark spot it mean you're like a newspaper is on top a sweater is on top or it's a bit behind the plant at that moment it's like it's like but you call it the lights at the sensors
big things that happens is people use them they can't find
materials cost etcetera
move a lot but we have some good points to start
hm that should keep everybody on their toes and challenge
