buttons and more buttons that is if we want to have more features
special features for the marketing that's really the voice
idea that be on off button buttons which are here are the mute buttons
child friendly design which few buttons colourful
material is plastic and dow for the buttons that's not so soft
buttons and the way this is shaped even though it's gonna be hard plastic it feels good in your hand
interrupt that but record remembered that there was no that was not to include it that was there room for any special features
green card and this is the menu button which will control of the colour sharpness blank
point of view one is the most important for the marketing these are in how i feel
ray for personal feature she would like to see to be integrated in this remote the industrial designer
bm also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels
play with the visible and then the voice recognition is our big selling point
list is really then realised in this prototype i wanted the shape
decision that we talk last time it us that these special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser
feature should be double up on which we could call on or in other words on which our campaign could be built
battery operated And would have to special cases
slide marketing expert to our who has to finally come up We just to market we can have anything with language dependent
admit i was little hard on our team
leave space money wise for the voice recogniser
everybody's gonna say the remote control which we are going to fill
special material which we are going to you was for the keys ease up plastic
