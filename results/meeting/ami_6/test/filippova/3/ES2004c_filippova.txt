option and they'll for rubber plot was thinking more of the buttons
press buttons like a keeping the standard buttons which are already explain
flip screen the top one is gonna be the lcd in the palm one that's gonna be the rubber or less buttons
kinetic is something people can use their fingers to press the button or we have inside like a small pointer thing people
decided on the most important aspect it required to the remote control to find
people put standard batteries and with this they could leave it in the sunlight for so charger
common feature is that the channel control and volume control rest other buttons
market research department and from our people need trendy they'll board of back
people who live in basements that's just not that many people but there are people
basic mold out of plastic that have like a rubber eyes cover the spongy
stick them in varying sizes or is it just one size of the buttons
rubber as a adding on for the grip something like to add to the design
kinetic one to come become with a what she a battery the case and watch
charge a remote wouldn't be a big or small as you want today
translates by the chip into account and then it's find out more about cost afterwards rights
big but if remotes away is good for a round
question is like a mobile you can change the colour of your colour the skin
decided it's on it leaving out the voice recognition that was the main
detachable mean maybe it you can change the body of the case
highlight of a mile Marketing department they want something to do with fruits i wouldn't say the design
rubber saying it would be good to open a can see something quite fancy looking inside
work quite easily to if you have to fold up a mobile phone
read it but the design is that you can change it every time
point out that the first of those findings fancy look-and-feel is d most important
lcd screen you could you bake it you could fit the problem
type thing and very expensive to buy new case if you gave type
current remotes use this so the can pcb board which pretty printed circuit board
top we have this button for what tends to keep frequently changing the channel changing on could be on the pointing device
small and it's portable and it is at different shape and the kinetic
Specifically them on to try and you can get the tv for it so on them to undo
real it looking at the battery it like it transfer long time
amount of probably need here and she'd be doing all the time
mention of feasibility whether we can incorporate the image of the company logo
market and so this feed back to the marketing department is really about trendwatching
icons you have is a good example of g you a topic user interface
price covers are going to be some Relatively cheap to re manufactured la
features we can go to the bottom cost issue without but it's a good idea
personal preferences another subject group we find from our consultants in paris and milan
size also so maybe it's standard people they might take this a space
applies to both are designers here it's not how it fits and if we flip open
important is twice as important as the second technologically innovative which is in turn
ran out of the night when you leave them on the side
picture he shows what are the standard models all for the computers
thoughtful colour if it is called black and white set the stripes
car engine meeting we spoke about a beeper thing that we should talk
hand so you get the degree it that you can we can pull
pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else but pretty
palm we're gonna have to wrap a rope wants the anti
buy a how long list and there's a double as would last and all it replaced lost
circuit and each which is connected to at different likes on the chip called the tio
