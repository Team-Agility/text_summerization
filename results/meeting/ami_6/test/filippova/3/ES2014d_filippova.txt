colour was actually i was assuming we had the red apple button
special material rubber wood titanium makes it true If you go for that's the high end that's point
colours autoseek that because maybe it's a rubber case and plastic case
assuming that all the buttons on the second the panel the hidden away but i'll put all be standard colour
lose one point seven was that the price was features we set
