option it on the second page is it where that say you were thinking of maybe having is a different colour buttons
button and the question was up all buttons or is that just one button our plan
apple and therefore that was the special colour it's just to supplement show
button supplements is just a supplement for all the buttons be made in a different material was on a button
difference will it make it for me the case we knew that point
remember the idea was to keep the colour did you get all that the company colour
biggest are you week and then you got a special button form
product look and feel fancy
innovation if you make it more in the in the two of them win these points of the being fancy
special material rubber wood titanium makes it true If you go for that's the high end that's point
liz a point on fashion
colour was actually i was assuming we had the red apple button
extra function buttons with a worry too much buttons have that as like a pauses
rid of the rubber wears the rest would be hard plastic case
buttons on the second the panel the hidden away but i'll put all be standard colour
volume related passes from the channel or less buttons you got the volume
Oakland of its thirteen point seven we do have kinetic the problem
kinetic power would remote control and i see what i'm the fall
room and innovative and we've got sixteen buttons
line at the bottom indicates that the power a light pole down and the extra
change it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements
sense at the moment we've got a total which we need to reduce the number one point
figure the this so the sample sensor and sample speaker be separate
sr us a baby put fashion elements try to buy
production evaluation as to how easy that would be to to manufacture
product on the website here real reaction there is a pretty high-tech and cutting edge
save this last time we make a look at and fit the idea
design and manufacturing process you would normally you go to a meeting
option if we're planning i'm just going for something chip and cheerful would be to make it then direction that we're gonna make a simple product
voice recognition was so that could find the remote with the got lost
year you could make mixtures model the same but as a whatever a lemon yellow
moment and if and we're going to do stand from that but the current
evaluation criteria be used for that the prototype against some criteria that we formulated
sense i remember that when you look then we've got solar power
debunk the computer channel that one aide so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question
lost overall spongy will bring this is maybe a bit more in a comfortable win can sleek and new age
features of the actual control would be more point maybe than the actual sfs
idea is that peak which ever persons and the other end can point in the right direction number two year
straight the email easily says it's evaluate the design at the top
sense you're comparing the product without the company logo and then you but you've got the space
find it now various things in in between the meetings and paste It didn't the ball meeting
library or or come back or go and see child lock does is it a look fancy
easiest way of doing it has to put some notes down the channel
adds to a presentation now we just like on the prototype
speech use it they gave me just everything you've written that page
casing that they're trying to use this software to To demonstrate how you could do the project
reckon that that you wanted to appeal to people like interesting gadgets
set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to identify mental one as at the end
finance
men to comment on leadership and that means easy whiteboard digital pens etcetera
