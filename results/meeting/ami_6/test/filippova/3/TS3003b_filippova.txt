functions in one No i In one remote control got a lot of bad answer
simple manner to put a lot of functions in one in one the remote control
requirements we need For those remote control simply not a lot of buttons required
suggest Let's have a discussion on the control functions Instead of a few roof less buttons
case for Design we should make a remote for the future
fifty percent of the people indicated that the remote control and get lost
remote control if we a make it a button x for big subtitles in push
press the button when the user presses a button if you press
focusing on elderly people or people forty plus they wanted to work
hard to learn how to operate a new control remote control so these are two factors
forty percent of the market for forty plus is like Pretty small
results also indicated that about one corner of the people questioned thought that remote
presentation about the working design So that we can move on to the second then faced the first this phase
er be just use their general function so i like the hours
important functions on a remote control then there are some one time to market
minimum number of buttons the real buttons we have to use rebecca
include teletext you do many people indicated that teletext simply was important feature
fancy too fancy design easy to learn few buttons on the right places
buttons the power button got online and teletext
tv would need a a function where you can actually if you all channels and scroll
workings simple so it's robust
decision on the control functions which you wanna include and those which we don't wanna include
screen in a way that which explains buttons you could been it would be lot easier
display for especially functions of the device you got a of a pot a part displayed go for power button
switch from channel one to like thirty five wanna push the next channel button thirty
mind things you said about the target group i requirements and design
targeting people of forty plus the chance that they will have a tv with internet access
meeting is the industrial designer of the components concept user interface designer
advantage point as if we have a fancy looking docking station lcd general functions
find a way between the functions you wanna use and the market expert
addition we did some market research see what the market consists of what ages are involved
Change our focus on elderly people though i have to adapt
additional eighty percent indicated that would spend the money a lot easier
products we're gonna make us perhaps if we design our design for the younger customers
sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty
remote control just what we've that idea in mind we could make tons of money
pretty soon and new tvs will have internet access
touch screen we're gonna go way above twelve and a half euros
telephones and the sony telephone a scroll button which is very useful and searching names
forty minutes for all of it so i suggest let's start with the first presentation
marketing right we can sell this just like i if you've heard about it in the news the elderly mobile phone
board tend to have a hard time understanding new devices
frequently used buttons should be emphasized especially the channel selection and volume selection power
greatly increase the production cost but these are just some small factories
point is we have to skip the teletext because in the real
tech materials the price is going to go sky
till forty five it remains feasible is it also greatly
research in a usability lab we observed
specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach
