switch on your tv to add another source not from two one remote control will have a light
remote control or is it specifically designed to a single device if you want to design
feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shape
press a button channel like that then the remote control it and it should be action
connection that it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the tv television
generally we can design different remotes for different people want a big buttons
money permits we can address some features then your remote control it won't be attractive
seventy dollars and there's unique remote control or then it but dvds
remotes which use the video be used to control the function for television
press one button in one more than it would change the channel
today i'm going to talk about the working design to a week
meeting in which it should it is useful remote control if it is dark
buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently
remote control or it sends it to the device it's a it's hard
research is that the complaints of people who don't have a tvd
functionality now on it with the be looking at different groups the children
question the question to be addressed here is only with the target group
question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense of any the basic design
discuss them with the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages
battery for power supply from the electricity like that it should be a battery
defunct that yellow and the functional requirements Liz muir sport michael
pro maybe a little easier on the who is our target group
television if the user wants to change the channel like that change the volume control
confusion so that's what i'm saying simplicity is good finding it's important can't you can't find
chip on your car at idiap remote control which does all the operations and vice
simple features and they don't take much to our armour just though investment
time at the set for viewing a particular program switching on and off are of particular program according to the user
shapes way that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for the different groups
tv controller as as an alarm clock to set than on a timing
important the thing that we could address our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room
earlier he was mentioned they have to elderly people who have limited function is their fingers and hands
question where the that's important
silly for children under six never chapel on so have you design
research that some extent of electronic entertainment control should be possible at the budget they were looking at the on the whole house
budget they were looking at that the price point we're looking at we should be able to make it work the tvt vcr the stereo was that maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance
model like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use our marketing campaign
slide their consulting industrial expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or your time
suggestions to come back to the other slide were saying we could suggest
package and then if people really want more colours they can buy an alternate packet
money because if we're gonna sell this thing the best time to sell this is christmas present Twenty
eliminated so that's a question be a mute point of view be funny the funny shape
cute so that the integrated circuit it takes energy from the power source
back in getting next week you're that they're never gonna come back
writing here should be an attractive impulse purchase a twenty five euros
big pile of things that we anybody can throw
electronics and all that's gonna be different is the plastic case we could probable moulded plastic
principle that will be they'll be kinda fun
instructions from higher out of that certain things should not be a considered
closing that they would be lunch break
order to make it really sellable we've got a short knowing curve make it's really intuitive in easy
