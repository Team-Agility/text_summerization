hire management be it should only control the tv to add another source not from two one remote control will have a light
remote control or is it specifically designed to a single device if you want to design
remote controls so can the remote control or then it but dvds
press a button channel like that then the remote control it and it should be action
generally we can design different remotes for different people want a big buttons
remotes for different light source which i use which can be used for controlling different functionalities of the television
today i'm going to talk about the working design to a week
press one button in one more than it would change the channel
buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently
remote control or it sends it to the device it's a it's hard
functionality now on it with the be looking at different groups the children
discuss them with the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages
question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense of any the basic design
battery for power supply from the electricity like that it should be a battery
defunct that yellow and the functional requirements Liz muir sport michael
add on specific functional buttons for children as as the elderly people who have limited function is their fingers and hands
chip on your car at idiap remote control which does all the operations and vice
meeting in which it should it is useful remote control if it is dark
question the question to be addressed here is only with the target group
pro maybe a little easier on the who is our target group
people were complaining about it might work and then my research is when they complained about how hard it is to anyone the changing
television if the user wants to change the channel like that change the volume control
confusion so that's what i'm saying simplicity is good finding it's important can't you can't find
time at the set for viewing a particular program switching on and off are of particular program according to the user
shapes way that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for the different groups
time is not o'clock then it should be switched off turn up at ten o'clock automatically so that nobody gets translated
accept eliminate these suggestions according to on design budget feasibility
helpful have we looked at the slides at the same time is it takes five years to develop
suggestions to come back to the other slide were saying we could suggest
timing is really gonna be as important as money
silly for children under six never chapel on so have you design
money because if we're gonna sell this thing the best time to sell this is christmas present Twenty
budget they were looking at that the price point we're looking at we should be able to make it work the tvt vcr the stereo was that maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance
cost much to set an alarm clock of it if you want more features that we can display o'clock
package and they can go to the store and for few francs or euros whatever they can buy an alternate packet with another two colours
internet from my research that some extent of electronic entertainment control should be possible at the budget they were looking at the on the whole house
end of the floor a simple one that's a stripe the whatever they have as another one in the package
design something that's very attractive to children the mommy we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing call
model like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use our marketing campaign
money extra money because maybe have an integrated circuit it takes energy from the power source
engineering point of view is in the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out there will buy for christmas for their child or for the husband
charge of trying to figure out what we should put on those things that i have to try to sell
back in getting next week you're that they're never gonna come back
writing here should be an attractive impulse purchase a twenty five euros
principle that will be they'll be kinda fun
nation initial stage i should just be open to want to suggestions
hold full screen
electronics and all that's gonna be different is the plastic case we could probable moulded plastic
instructions from higher out of that certain things should not be a considered
easy that it can be easily identified as a product or for of off the company and that there's no mistake but it could be somebody else was bringing this ad so wanna going to check
