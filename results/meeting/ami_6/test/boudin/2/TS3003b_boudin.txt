Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote controller
simple manner to put a lot of functions in one in one the remote works the user
requirements we need For those remote control only to operate a tv there simply not a lot of buttons required
suggest Let's have a discussion on the control functions Instead of a few roof less buttons
case for Design we should make a remote for the future
fifty percent of the people indicated that the remote control
point of advantage in our remote control if we a make it a button x for big subtitles in push
button when the user presses a button if you press
research into What elderly people or people from forty to eighty
remote control is hard to learn how to operate a tv
forty percent of the market for forty plus that's the markets we have to get the targets
results also indicated that about one corner of the people questioned thought that remote control there's rsi
important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get agreement about the user requirements technical function design and the working design then but on functionality
er be just use their general functions of the remote control
important functions on a remote control then there are some one time to market
minimum number of buttons the real buttons we have to use rebecca
addition people indicated that teletext simply was important feature for the remote control so it's pretty
fancy design easy to learn few buttons on the right places
buttons the power button got online and teletext
tv would need a a function where you can actually if you all channels and scroll
workings simple so it's robust
factors that should be included in the design the size
idea to have just a little screen in a way that which explains buttons you could been it would be lot easier
general fear of the functions of the device you got a of a pot a part displayed go for power button
switch from channel one to like thirty five wanna push the next channel button thirty
discussion possible hold on the new project requirements that's clear
targeting people of forty plus the chance that they will have a tv with internet access
meeting is the industrial designer of the components concept user interface designer
buttons we talked about the docking station lcd general functions
find a way between the functions you wanna use and the market expert
addition we did some market research see what the market consists of what ages are involved
Change our focus on elderly people though i have to adapt
additional eighty percent indicated that would spend the money on a fancy looking remote control
smart to invest in dice in design and not in in the product which is specially designed for the younger customers
sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty
remote control just what we've that idea in mind we could make tons of money
pretty soon and new tvs will have internet access
pricing we need a great deal of people would indicated that an lcd screen or a very expensive screen
telephones and the sony telephone a scroll button which is very useful and searching names
forty minutes for all of it so i suggest let's start with the first presentation
marketing right we can sell this just like i if you've heard about it in the news the elderly mobile phone
board tend to have a hard time understanding new devices
channel selection and volume selection but gotta turn on a scale of one to ten for relevancy the power and teletext
bruce the production cost but these are just some small factories
point is we have to skip the teletext because in the real the full upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be that's the past
tech materials the price is going to go sky
till forty five it remains feasible is it also greatly
research in a usability lab we observed
specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach
