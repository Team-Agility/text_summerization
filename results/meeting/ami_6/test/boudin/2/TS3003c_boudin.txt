interest because this would be db s would that be the innovativeness in the remote control be standing up straight in the king station
elderly people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control and at the same time
line of doing this means functions which are not featured another remote controls
leads us to some personal preferences the remote control is to play in your hand
people will recognise And the buttons
choose for that option the docking station could be one of the e marketing issues
Changing channels and changing it channel welfare
older people like to shake their remote control the fresh
Innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design
button to keep it a simple i want push doubleclick it so you get the excess subtitles for people which can of walk and we small
start by choosing a case
case the supplement and the buttons it really depends on the designer and the chips
requirements are teletext docking station and small screen would be are main points of interest
older people so they would prefer design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station
voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier
program it so you got on the left side a little on the right site buttons we have to use the on off sound higher or lower the numbers zero to nine and that buttons and more again but one button for shifting percent i like it and channel or for putting it out sounds you can just give a sign say sound
control which would fit in with a wooden cover and Plastic cover or the plastic or rubber
pretty big influence or production price and image will give you Little bit of an impression about the look and feel That the remote control
top of that the lcd screen would held in making the remote control easier
group specific findings the older people prefer dark colours they like recognisable

industrial design and user interface designer are going to work
group we're focusing on the people of sixty eighty years old this is These factors are slightly more equal
points of interest In this meeting are the conceptual specification of components conceptual specification of design and also trendwatching
half of half as important factor there is the wooden colour
brings us to the discussion about their concepts in the materials
trend watch a year Presentation showed it people like wood but it raised the price
point i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes rsi
speak speech recognition and special button for selecting a set that's just a three year olds customers
side so it's run a normal the single
mobile phones so like the nokia mobile phones when you can't change the case
build in a function of which shows the channel or some which the television the solar cells
personally think the lcd screen you wanna use with the extra information is easy
consulted some additional trendwatch trendwatchers after the original trendwatchers should turn about what the The best design
