Buying an objective of a two control the remote control the I found some something about speech recognition
apply the remote control on which you can apply different case covers
older people so they would prefer design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station
interest because this would be db s would that be the innovativeness in the remote control be standing up straight in the king station
Elderly people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control and at the same time
cover of the docking station could be one of the e marketing issues
extra buttons so people are more money
Changing channels and changing it channel welfare
choose for that option the docking station would can become obsolete
line of doing this means functions which are not featured another remote controls
order for functions for subtitle one button to keep it a simple i want push doubleclick it so you get the excess subtitles for people which can of walk and we small
Choose for the battery That brings
energy but just a simple battery which you can read a little docking station is just as good a much cheaper
ages of four is recognition by finding back your remote
case the supplement and the buttons it really depends on the designer and the chips
requirements are teletext docking station and small screen would be are main points of interest
Innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design
discard the voice recognition and special button for selecting a set that's just a three year
top of that the lcd screen would held in making the remote control easier
program it so you got on the left side a little on the right site buttons we have to use the on off sound higher or lower the numbers zero to nine and that buttons and more again but one button for shifting percent i like it and channel or for putting it out sounds you can just give a sign say sound
buttons on both the left and right side of put the sound
case we could use kinetic energy like in a watch
options we could use the basic normal battery for a six months
reach years about bit a large lcd should display or just a small display
control which would fit in with a wooden cover and Plastic cover or the plastic or rubber
casing d and affection department can deliver single curved and double curved
talk about the energy source we can use the basic battery
advise to bring two editions one with a woodlike colour and maybe feel and one with a grey black colour
industrial design and user interface designer are going to work
group specific findings the older people prefer the corners to be round
encounter any problems with Choosing channel
trendwatchers i consulted advise that it should be the remote control on the docking station should be telephone shape
points of interest In this meeting are the conceptual specification of components conceptual specification of design we have to discuss about so form
brings us to the discussion about their concepts in the materials
problem that left and the person's Use a different hand the functions
hour earlier market research indicated that was by far the most important factor there is the wooden colour
lcd screen like you would have on the most advanced mobile phones so like the nokia mobile phones when you can't change the case
fit the image unless we would start to product lines For should follow function
point i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes rsi
swing before you can watch television the solar cells
trend watch a year Presentation showed it people like wood but it raised the price
consulted some additional trendwatch trendwatchers after the original trendwatchers should turn about what the The best design
group we're focusing on the people of sixty eighty years old this is These factors are slightly more equal
increase costs assignation and significantly
inform you buy the trendwatching and then over the past
year mentions the last meeting already I hope you enjoy
supplement we could to of that later a rubber belt like and i slipped
instructions send the body coach
distribute it some more on cats questionnaires
