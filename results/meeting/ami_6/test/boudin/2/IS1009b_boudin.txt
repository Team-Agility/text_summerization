hire management be it should only control the tv to add another source not from two one remote control and you lost your remote control but maybe you can find with the lights
hard to design a remote control for my people are devices
feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shape
action like if you press a button channel like that then the remote control would send the centre so you send the signal
remote control or should have a switch on or off but it to use it can sit anywhere in the room in front of the tv and they can control the functionalities different functionalities of the tv they should be a signal
design different remotes for different people want a big buttons
feature a user would like to have as the compact ness of the car remote control
remote controller so that what they were buttons are presently a child second be like you if you have key kids and all then they'll be sleeping with remote controls so can the remote control or should automatically
types of remotes which use the video we what are the infrared light source which i use which can be used for controlling the different functionalities in the television it at the file off the standard remote the students
doubt they use it can buttons to use research on a particular channel if you press the other button and that would be to change the colour
page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design of the remote control
meeting in which it should it is useful remote control and it goes we can meet or like fruit or cent
question is how much will that set us back if it's a forty percent we make large buttons also if you want to have more features in your remote control and then there should be more buttons so different buttons will grow differently shape for people of either for children
input and it to transforms into in front runner bits some of the would be it's like but a particular frequency the device like tv or that you can be spent something like that so i remote
research is that the complaints of people have about remote controls
functionality now on it with the be looking at different groups the children issue can be addressed we see shape and we scholars
lead function is probably the question of the buttons a wee thing the target group or sub groups the question
question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense of any the basic design
messages like they should be a user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features which are user would like to have on their remote
battery it can't be an la and the chip supplied like you have to i like the switch it can it can connect your remote control or to a power supply from the electricity they should not be so much small are lots of so the kids
defunct that yellow and the functional requirements Liz muir sport michael
decision we have to take in this meeting is call what is our target group and for this one target group we're gonna design
favourite channel like that change the volume and a square is for changing channels so that people can develop a tactile sensor
mobile phones we have different covers like that design i know so that you can find it so gotta concentrate on the features that help you find
chip on your car at idiap remote control which does all the operations and vice thing or the chips which is lights
pry are helping with prioritising of of the features and have the lock and the colour
view a particular program that's eight nine o'clock you can said that time is not o'clock on the screen you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute
chance of having so the same as you mentioned buttons but maybe several different shapes way that different shape of a t and i've bad for more compact ability
tv controller as as an alarm clock to set than on a timing
important the thing that we could address our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room
add on specific functional buttons for children as as the elderly people who have limited function is their fingers and hands
question where the that's important that children
friendly it should not in a skin disease are some things and the energy by the children and that made a leash but they cannot buy three different remotes they would like to buy
internet from my research that some extent of electronic entertainment control should be possible at the budget they were looking at the on the whole house
budget they were looking at that the price point we're looking at we should be able to make it work the tvt vcr the stereo was that maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance
model like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use our marketing manager which would call first addressing the needs and desires
michael but what would have straight to the second slide their consulting industrial expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or your time is it takes five years to develop
back to you to help we got the suggestions according to on design budget feasibility
corporate image is being maintained and that the corporate colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package and they can go to the store and for few francs or euros whatever they can buy an alternate packet with another two colours
personal preferences in this project or are we really have to concentrate on this is all that is the selling point the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase
eliminated so that's a question be a mute point of view is in the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out there will buy for christmas for their child or for the husband
cute so that the integrated circuit can't stand the signals and tv can pull for the Actions
mind cells they always say be back still come back
writing here should be an attractive impulse purchase a twenty five euros an activity
big pile of things that we anybody can throw
removable plastic case is that you can have a striped one or you can have for a simple
principle that will be they'll be kinda fun
easy that it can be easily identified as a product or for of off the company and that there's no mistake but it could be somebody else was bringing this ad so wanna going to check this year so we not getting too much off track here with with the things you wanna look at these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate
closing that they would be lunch break
order to make it really sellable we've got a short knowing curve make it's really intuitive in easy
