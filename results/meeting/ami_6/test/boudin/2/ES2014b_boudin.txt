menu bus then you'd use the other buttons they teach them could have a number buttons to actually do this type of functions
proportion would spend more for so that a fancy remote controls for controlling the tv
written some research into the functional requirements of people want to have a remote controls
buttons than most the controls on the market we say is that there is quite a lot people to just sat around and flicks
avoid having a second product goes overseas to do the same for the tv like i should we try to set the remote control set of setting buttons for the picture and brightness and the audio settings they weren't used very often people
people concentrate on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons
user interface way she is the play the person's on the actual remote
biggest frustration was the effect on your remote control it was difficult to learn all buttons are all the functions and to find
sections faced is the research i made on on the remote control
Close all comes with the tv can speak consumer and it changes in channels do we have to actual channel either by pressing the number that you want or by channel you want and that would cut down your time
size you wanna take a poll the touch the remote possibility
lots of different buttons this is the basic
people to grasp justify the menu for all the functions on the remote control that's worth
decided that we don't need a teletext button direction and then at the back
symbols like the triangles in the squares and arrows as as the words on them terribly functions
solidify what the speech recognition software in the remote control
solve frustration of losing
models within the market a summarisation of the internet now to start is for the components required for the remote control the function as the r and also the masses
basic method is this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set so that the desired function is performed
remote for tv only otherwise project Would become too complex with which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations and i did you have that information gonna marketing
person is legal over about it into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older people people were quite so keen on speech recognition
scaling the sam that you whistle a clap after a number
detailed Functions hidden at the back
general television purposes of a say you have channels one two five this point in time
whistle back like that part be really simple
switch the television on off maybe stand-by because of the nyquist like just another meeting
big advantage if we did have some them whistle by functions the moment gonna something comes back
Passes if we could get something which was quite quick and simple i would give us the parts but other remotes
tv we discussed that last time and an actual find
basis that if we've got to go for teaching to the whole age range you want something that's easy to make a user guys for fourteen bus remote
basic system that's tea pots the remote
numbers and then some device will become inoperable or only a probable in certain circumstances
sends their ass you press sends message to The chip
problem with that in that the television makes noise so it could end up talking to itself and changing the channel
major concerns of the consumer so that we can have it as a selling point if you're not going with the voice recognition except rap has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time
sense you could have done if you've got a hundred channels Then if you had an easy it's like to see that and cats you make any number so with that was kinda
primary considerations to get the project finished within has short time
personal preferences from the marketing is every school with some sleek it's a good-looking high-tech a design louise
build the stock but maybe you could have a fast
forty minutes which to first meeting to read to discuss the various options
planning to proceed so that the next Each person that's got a task to do is clear from this meeting is any So one know how long we've got a complete at times and then we can report back to the next meeting starts think if you get any additional information that to wanna you have to that point i'm using would be relevant to other people in terms of their doesn't decision making process the way you should communicate that as quickly as possible and not until the next meeting
buttons are be have to apply some better instructions about all of us to work
buttons we do is cut ten eleven twelve thirteen or fourteen fifteen sixteen
vote so we if you carry on standby a power supply of us in the time
management is concerned and it's become outdated and you to the popularity of the internet and you don't need teletext
infrared there's been use quite successfully is the batteries sound reasonable power
email and said to make that to whatever device we come up with at the end of the had to incorporate and the corporate colour and slogan
expense hear the source it could sections sec
dad's watch it from the other week and it's too dark so hard to go through it and then the brightness
leave out you got five standard you've got the bbc
