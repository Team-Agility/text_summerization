written some research into the functional requirements of people about remote control it was difficult to learn all buttons are all the functions and to find
sections faced is the research i made on on the remote control
function to school with changing the channel either by pressing the number that you want or by channel channel up and down volume
lots of different buttons on the remote control set of setting buttons for the picture and brightness and the audio settings they weren't used very often people

point if you're not going with the voice recognition software in the remote control is lost in a room roll sensitive having it to the speech recognition change the channel as a problem
keyboard and out be cheaper one channel and then you have another remote for all of those channels that are all and when you take into account to sky and do some or maybe sellers
people in our lcd menu with the un use different buttons are be have to apply
remote for tv only otherwise project Would become too complex with which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations and i did you have that information gonna marketing
symbols like the triangles in the squares and arrows as as the words on them terribly functions
individual buttons for them like on the tv can speak consumer and it changes in channels
detailed Functions hidden at the back
market we say is that there is quite a lot people to just sat around and flicks
