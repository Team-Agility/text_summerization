important thing at the remote controls that you can switch channels
enter a new market we remote control
remote current remote controls are just for one purpose
technical functions have to be designed governor know for what kinds of issues
user interface designer has to look at the technical function
fruit or a i'm the industrial designer has to look at the working design
detailed design how or two we go up to begin are really about how the bit to techno of it's it's possible technical

current colour you can change
euro and the production costs may not be more than up twenty and a half euro
