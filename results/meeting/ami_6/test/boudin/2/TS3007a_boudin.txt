important thing at the remote controls that you can switch channels
enter a new market we remote control
technical functions have to be designed governor know for what kinds of issues
user interface designer has to look at the technical function
fruit or a i'm the industrial designer has to look at the working design
row when the selling price for the remote will be at twenty five euro
requirements we don't fit the technical functions
interface might be easy to have to draw here and display
current colour you can change
important is that we use different colours and different pen widths
euro and the production costs may not be more than up twenty and a half euro
points from marketing point of view is the most important
working on the user requirements you're working the technical
pick the wrong a function is some marketing expert
half euro so from my point if you i don't think it's the gonna be very very high tech high definition all from a turn remote for twelve fifth at twelve euro
