buttons like that people they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button
idea that be on off button buttons and next but then volume but and stop type of buttons switch to control features scholar contrast rub yes etcetera
interrupt that but record remembered that there was no that was not to include it that was there room for any special features for the marketing that's really the voice
material is plastic and dow for the buttons that's not so soft rubber
speech recognition thing we're gonna they're gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the speech
buttons and the way this is shaped even though it's gonna be hard plastic it feels good in your hand
decision that we talk last time it us that these special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser which will recognise the use those words and then you to act
include that's two buttons for in pleasing or they can be using the board
special case made out of plastic side is very strong not using any harm for materials supplements plastic
point if you and feasible former marketing point of view one is the most important factor is that we should get to market before our competition
ray for personal favourite really she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote the industrial designer
bm also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels
head looks and voice recognition is our big selling point
feature to speak we have all would have for this remote it is an artist a shape to be bio warfare can do one anything with angles a little square one to be comfy and round
industrial Designer i that it looks would be very important on this your remote
feature should be double up on which we could call on or in other words on which our campaign could be built
fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel she feels that's really what people want to die
maximum we have another four point three euros so four thirty
leave space money wise for the voice recogniser
presented also an oversized remote our which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose
model of the remote control which we are going to fill
play with the visible and then the voice recognition
push it may be all had slides presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation
slide marketing expert to our who has to finally come up We just to market this product has been watching the competition has done some research on the internet and also has used for personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote so it should be small Easy to use and it should be eye-catching
personally i'm pretty happy
middle as far as other competitors At our colour it's great colours or bright and warming really do great job
method for us but the marketing of this thing is first as the big question is are we happy with the leadership hope this project
groups we don't want somebody to suddenly come to listen tell us that this button is toxic and some charles what do we want selling
paradoxically the other features in other words the lock the feel and a shape that's what people are gonna get in the story they don't have a television
easily fit into a into the hands and you can access all the buttons easy
call that it's maybe not in the best position in the room and you can you reach it over here so you don't have to turn it a random turn it upside down move
stopping is if you're you're watching the sake in china and then you go to the tents china and if you want to go back to the second channel if it is down to two words that like it would be to the next round
green card and this is the menu button which will control of the colour sharpness blank
energy source we is say that it's battery operated And would have to special cases
show the prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups
scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical
concludes to presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting
