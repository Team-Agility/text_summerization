findings that we came up with just to recap are here at the criteria
design should minimise rsi e and easy to locate
spongy feel would be in the rubber so you program
feel about this prototype model relating to find a final presentation
state of the evaluation is really for as a team to a value we if we have no got a product specification and prototype design but to the criteria that we call from our market research
budget and it still makes such an innovative eyes and people
decided on the inside we could do possibly either have some sold that sold a logo on it and say maybe an engraving of the later on the top screen as you said is would be in set black more lcds touch screen
people are used to buying batteries are not gonna say i'm not getting this is about to buy a car shaped remote control
double that back to that slide if you don't have a notice
feel on the basis of that of these evaluation findings we can go ahead and i could use this as a prototype and marketing
base because it just going back to work for the means is the first changing remote control is in the product which that are on a ship that china shit
euros now because they're saying they're quite willing to pay more for better product
plastic body with a as a standard colour was why all like all a light plane but the changeable fat faces with that allow you to get any any one of the number of colours the it's false customers
code for the rubber buttons with a combination of lcd and rubber current design right funky
bottom sections it's top secret it's it is this conspiracy
ratings high end of the upper end of this go ahead with that i really doubt
feel about this we've got our got the highest reading of meeting the specifications that's definitely true for two or three six criteria that we want in this remote control or a fancy look-and-feel technological innovation it should be easy to use it should incorporate current fashion trends and the with the two main
fashion trends that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours
account Overheads Like arts being paid thing and the heating for the building do you think our party increase everything all the costs no it's it's going to be feasible cost-wise
bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons like that for volume up and down channel up and down power on and off and to things to that affect
slightly on the list of to use voice recognition for this class like it upgraded version you could choose
type of phone
design minimise the issue of repetitive strain injury Do we feel on the basis
fifty percent profit
size we go it's quite small but with a minor
ship that china shit the dvd player the video apply the tv Some this in the other really more tvs in this range
top and the buttons of the bomb what to say is sorrowful
rate you on how much includes the meeting summary in question
include stop it delegating it in my role as project with recommendations
handy The points all raised seem to have been source
stay at your email system mall i had we actually Had had more time and if we'd been separated mall
criteria that i've just mentioned a call that's like a cop
television and products coming up but a giving we have in dealing with la's
law not as we reported widely ideas from their innovations
data collection of the criteria as we saw one the previous meeting was based on the user requirements trends found in a marketing report a marketing strategy of our company does what we discussed
work out the average for that gonna get is a very slightly different systems been shot in the room
share a set that would tear do you wanna join a should do you wanna hold a search resume that also be quite cheap
decided to use the kinetic cells
wide choice they would be attached
Surprising to me is like the people don't we do a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones like every I want to see you in your lunch like that and new for television
data and the infrared And centre would be on the on one of the u but they bottom line adjust to the front
fudge shop and then you just get it prints on the plastic good pray you pay a lot extra
sample sensor and sample speaker
liza would need to separate pcb still be joined at the hinge three some sort labelling
sideline a thought maybe having a beep or function the case materials could be soft rubbery changeable
Gene we discussed leadership and teamwork you to create it that wonderful specimen of a bit later model
philly decimal places
necessarily sell at twenty five times to use Twenty five percent
terrific watch out for that Typical
press the in That's cream cup
