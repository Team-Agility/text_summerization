findings that we came up with just to recap are here at the criteria
criteria any the fancy look-and-feel how do we feel about this prototype model relating to find a final presentation
budget and it still makes such an innovative eyes and people
state of the evaluation is really for as a team to a value we if we have no got a product specification and prototype design but to the criteria that we call from our market research
finally on the interface the top screen as you said is would be in set black more lcds touch screen
moved away from our much loved idea of the kind battery just went with the standard battery is that make each day
feel on the basis of that of these evaluation findings we can go ahead and i could use this as a prototype and marketing
base because it just going back to work for the means is the first changing remote control devices be save it all be some possible we see a mobile phones
remote control is in the product which that are on a ship that china shit
fashion trends that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours
plastic body with a as a standard colour was why all like all a light plane but the changeable fat faces with that allow you to get any any one of the number of colours the it's false customers
spongy feel would be in the rubber so you program
bottom sections it's top part
ratings high end of the upper end of this go ahead with that i really doubt
obvious just big buttons with a combination of lcd and rubber current design right funky
top lcd screen you can see that would be self And you say it's it would be sold that sold a logo on it and say maybe an engraving of the later on the top and the buttons of the bomb what to say is sorrowful
underneath be rubber as the rubber at the outer casing
feel about this we've got our got the highest reading of meeting the specifications that's definitely true for two or three six criteria that we want in this remote control or a fancy look-and-feel technological innovation it should be easy to use it should incorporate current fashion trends and the with the two main
easy to hold a search resume that also be quite cheap
design minimise repetitive strain injury Do we feel on the basis
stay at your email system mall i had we actually Had had more time and if we'd been separated mall
slightly on the list of to use voice recognition for this class like it upgraded version you could choose
television and products coming up but a giving we have in dealing with la's
ship that china shit the dvd player the video apply the tv Some this in the other really more tvs in this range
size we go it's quite small but with a minor
speaker tech way that they'll make it twelve point five is it twelve point fifty
account Overheads Like arts being paid thing and the heating for the building do you think our party increase everything all the costs no it's it's going to be feasible cost-wise
include stop it delegating it in my role as project with recommendations
agreement that we were given that was very specific we've done not required
criteria that i've just mentioned a call that's like a cop
twenty five times to use Twenty five percent of the cost
Surprising to me is like the people don't we do a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones like every I want to see you in your lunch like that and new for television
law not as we reported widely ideas from their innovations
fudge shop and then you just get it prints on the plastic
work out the average for that gonna get is a very slightly different systems been shot in the room
data collection of the criteria as we saw one the previous meeting was based on the user requirements trends found in a marketing report a marketing strategy of our company does what we discussed leadership and teamwork
decided to use the kinetic cells
fun and means whiteboard digital pens
data and the infrared And centre would be on the on one of the u but they bottom line adjust to the front
extra because it's individually being a plastic good pray you pay
sample sensor and sample speaker
sideline a thought maybe having a beep or function the case materials could be soft rubbery changeable
liza would need to separate pcb still be joined at the hinge three some sort labelling
philly decimal places
Teamwork you to create it that wonderful specimen of a bit later model
fifteen minutes to catch up with that but i hope include stop
bounce off each other i necessarily sell at twenty five euros
woulda been handy to have this beginning
terrific watch out for that Typical
press the in That's cream cup
