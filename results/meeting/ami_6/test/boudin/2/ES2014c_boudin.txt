colour of a rubber buttons require rubber case the spongy
simple push button and like that we're going for the simple printed circuit board
careful what you put on the buttons in the case for the shape
compete with the functions the scroll buttons that would require a slightly more advanced say cobalt and if we just have the standards and push button
button see the stand-by button is quite kind a separate from all the other functions
voice recognition we can use call it just to find out what circuit board that requires maybe for many did they make a decision
simple circuit board and i'll be an extra up in addition to make sense
dolphin with what one button for the spongy feel of the material should be spongy which is country
voice recognition technology out they because i was might not cover the same functions that teleconference to might be good idea to market has the find a function rather than as a speech function to find your remote
channel function of the most of time do you could change
user interface which is all the buttons was the inside and the channel
remote control market isn't a thing which takes in These kinds of fashion trends
main problem is and how frequently do the fashions change
buttons shape like fruit or vegetable shaped remote say in the shape of a pen
standard case it means we can all fit together on top of each other there for storage propose is a shop so makes it easier dick and if you stop
perform any of the remote functions and specialist remote ball
actual buttons but does affect the printed circuit board again depends on which features we want a national minimum wage
convinced or whether having changeable covers would be something that people buy into with about files
change in a sense and the production you want things to stay
incorporates the trend also the same time not confusing people If you're looking for functionality
fashion trends are the people want clothes and shoes and things with the fruit and vegetables
pens i forgot the speech recognition came a set of peace for information
decision on them to design of the volume up volume Volume
scroll through required a regular chip to display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expensive
trends ought to take important for this type of catching
guilt which is which you wind up like an idea of the watches and you move the remote
require more fun stick a poster is next a price in a sense of it which spent stick with the standard the case
difference in the cost of packaging could be quite important easily the total cost of the product
feel it down This this but the ball much of highlights it but the scroll wheel didn't the voice recognition that we'd have to get a more costly circuit board
single curved and double curved it's maybe it comes up slightly
young people like phone generation that's what they put it put on the market research has been on that side of it and the jury
incorporate bit of call it if one wants to find a way to incorporate this trend so this is a catchy people's imaginations
sizable by of information on a limited number of buttons it was sixteen
change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit days next year's that was the animal the relevance
scroll through required a regular and what required and downs and therefore able to see that then we could make a decision on that point
decision now in the sense that this is the point at which were discussing that issue
issue for the buses is depending on which material we use if we use rubber
model way it can control four devices tv cable satellite radio dvd would feel
casing beep or any colour of the the windows bad you still be able to see it clearly from wiki same route product
grieving just work on keeping the bus things like a simple to make it let's complete president
future reference the possibility of adding an extra features the extra cost To take care of specialist market segments
backup features on the second page So that it could to You the technical requirements and the customers
find a fairly quickly when you move or at your kid modelling stages to where How much but how much but i hope liable is plasticene
talk about the curvature of the keys
people's say that it's the lock they want a fancy design this on a remote control
modifications you have your basic model to the model three and a half
watches which you you shake to power that somehow mechanism inside house a few movement so you'd miss
interpret that it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly
phase the power supply we have the option that's just a standard battery
ball would probably do we want to focus on those like such as the children
