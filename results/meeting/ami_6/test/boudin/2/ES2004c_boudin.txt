context of really close together and then when you press down on the rubber buttons there's you hold in the palm
type of buttons because the buttons which are already explain
lcd display on the top side of the flip top rubber i suppose and on the bottom side were fruit and vegetable
option when we open up people can use their fingers to press the button or we have inside like a small pointer thing people
general findings from that was that in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls where People want a fancy look and feel rather than the current functional look-and-feel of remote controls
referring back to so the charging is that compatible with a standard battery so we could people
common feature is that the channel control and volume control rest other buttons
market research it's not thing that people in paris and milan
people who live in basements that's just not that many people so i watch tv in the night
image of all in my head if something shape like that maybe about that size made of plastic fits into the palm of a hard rubber eyes cover the spongy
stick them in varying sizes or is it just one size of the buttons
strong but it should be left factor of design of the edge components
form of a it's a small a cell which it charges and say and the side the size of a watch i watch battery
big or small as you want today to charge us to the day and then you've got to charge just for the evening
translates by the chip into account and then it's find out of this led a in the sequence of log on and off busts
big but if remotes away is good for a round
rubber i suppose spongy apart from that we're just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours like the vibrant colours or red chili
decided it's on it leaving out the voice recognition is feasible
feedback you can even the last meeting for me from your report it's not just a case of having little r or hidden somewhere that you want it to be obvious that it's our product
input from the previous meeting especially from the marketing an industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility
contrast between if the whole thing it's gonna be this rubber sleep on my list
light it has to have different fascias for the phone myself just titanium it does mark very easily to if you have to fold up a mobile phones
availability of the components we have in stock that in mind
trend towards a spongy feel to materials some of the things so we looked at last time on that for jury
buttons on the screen you could you bake it you could fit the problem
squashy design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case if you gave type thing and very expensive just a process
current remotes use this so the can pcb board which pretty printed circuit boards but that be joined by Why is all like some link
votes so if on this simpler board on the top of a look at it you buttons which are like volume or channel changing on could be on the pointing device
small and it's portable and it is at different shape and the kinetic charger we've decided to decided
people have a light on in the room anyway so they could get when you got tv on the on site then you pick ups change it then you put it on the side
life of the phonetic battery it like it transfer long time
watch it on your wrist so it on your whole point it's a new part of the whole time with the wood charger
mention of feasibility whether we can incorporate the image of the company logo
methods we used to decide on Current trends and so one market and so this feed back to the marketing department is really about trendwatching
icons you have is a good example of g you a topic user interface and trend watching
parts are already in stock then i went be cheap to re manufactured la
features we can go to the bottom cost issue without but it's a good idea
personal preferences another subject group we find from our consultants in paris and milan who did attended all the design in fashion fears and the fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes shoes and furniture
size also so maybe it's standard people they might take this a space you actually need a physical to solve handle to wind
read up occurs to me a applies to both are designers here it's not how it fits and if we flip open
letters in nightclubs the art matters when you turn lcd display
light cuisine then i would and she be the side a charging
comedy does the picture he shows what are the standard models all for the computers
thoughtful colour if it is called black and white set the stripes
Easy i have a key you could have a jew doubt
charger up i don't think you'd ever need to actually physically starts taking out to make it work because you surely all things would still be moving in the short distances
pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else but pretty
palm we're gonna have to wrap a rope wants the anti
buy a how long list and there's a double as would last and all it replaced lost
circuit and each which is connected to at different likes on the chip and say sends a different message
