context of really close together and then when you press down on the rubber buttons like a keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex more than the things so we can divide the circuit
main idea of the whole thing is to say use you just press buttons because the buttons which the set
lcd display on the top side of the flip top rubber or less buttons there's you hold in the palm
decided on the most important aspect it required to the remote controls
option when we open up people who live in basements that's just not that many people so i watch tv in the night
common feature is that the channel control and volume control buttons
image of all in my head if something shape like that maybe about that size made of plastic fits into the palm of a hard rubber eyes cover the spongy
decisions that we've made tennessee charging to watch tight Batteries and to sell a charging is that compatible with a standard battery the case and watch i watch
input from the previous meeting especially from the marketing an industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility
stick them in varying sizes or is it just one size of the buttons
today to charge us to the day and then you've got to charge a remote wouldn't be a big but if remotes away is good for a round
remote control you were saying watching tv remote so the moment
applies to both are designers here it's not how it fits and if we flip open to the field
translates by the chip into account and then it's find out of this led a in the sequence of log on and off busts
buttons that they're on the screen and this lcd screen
people have a light on in the room anyway so they could get when you got tv
rubber i suppose spongy apart from that we're just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours like the vibrant colours or red chili
methods we used to decide on Current trends and so one market research it's not thing that people need trendy they'll board of back to the marketing department they want something to do with fruits i wouldn't say the design
votes so if on this simpler board on the top we have this button for what tends to keep frequently changing the channels
decided it's on it leaving out the voice recognition is feasible
feedback you can even the last meeting for me from your report it's not just a case of having little r or hidden somewhere that you want it to be obvious that it's our product
light it has to have different fascias for the phone myself just titanium it does mark very easily to if you have to fold up a mobile phones
squashy design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case if you gave type thing and very expensive just a process
mention of feasibility whether we can incorporate the image of the company logo
general findings from that was that in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls where People want a fancy look and feel to materials some of the things so we looked at last time on that for jury
life of the phonetic battery it like it transfer long time
current remotes use this so the can pcb board which pretty printed circuit board
features we can go to the bottom cost issue without but it's a good idea
parts are already in stock then i went be cheap to re manufactured la
produce the if they used time we be get feedback from the design fear switch to something else is coming in it so we easy to first is to produce that they can be slipped
size also so maybe it's standard people they might take this a space you actually need a physical to solve handle to wind
watch it on your wrist so it on your whole point it's a new part of the whole time with the wood charger
normal batteries would be the cheapest a light cuisine then i would and she be the side a charging
top of a look at it you buttons which are like volume or channel changing on could be on the pointing device
computer have icons you have is a good example of g you a topic user interface and trend watching
personal preferences another subject group we find from our consultants in paris and milan who did attended all the design in fashion fears and the fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes shoes and furniture
letters in nightclubs the art matters when you turn lcd display
charger up i don't think you'd ever need to actually physically starts taking out to make it work because you surely all things would still be moving in the short distances
main Which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognitions feature
thoughtful colour if it is called black and white set the stripes
comedy does the picture he shows what are the standard models all for the computers
availability of the components we have in stock that in mind
switch the tv on the on site then you pick ups change it then you put it on the side
Easy i have a key you could have a jew doubt
sets closing we have forty minutes
buy a how long list and there's a double as would last and all it replaced lost
fit the problem with it is that it's flat and so you can't be lots
back everybody Hope you've had fun
palm we're gonna have to wrap a rope wants the anti
swapped i try and susan are the ones that we use all timer on the bottom part
