aim is to make a new remote control
important thing at the remote control that you can switch channels
enter a new market we remote control
technical functions have to be designed governor know for what kinds of issues
graphical user interface designer has to look at the technical function
industrial designer has to look at the working design
selling price for the remote will be at twenty five euro
requirements we don't fit the technical functions
interface might be easy to have to draw and then display
current colour you can change
important is that we use different colours and different pen widths
euro and the production costs may not be more than up twenty and a half euro
points from marketing point of view is the most important
work on the user requirements you're working the technical
tenth any my function is some marketing expert
point if you i don't think it's the gonna be very very high tech high definition all from a turn remote for twelve fifth at twelve euro
choose or coloured shoes and with and draw
back to the next meeting action
detailed design how or two we go up to begin are really about how the bit to techno of it's it's possible technical
meeting has a few things to tell you about the setting
lose side of the user friendly
distinguish from from current problem to use not difficult
phase because we have two and twenty five minutes
states is is broken up into two stages individual work in a meeting
fun than before we did begin really do the hard
easier but at the other hand a pen like there is easy to hold in your hand
multipurpose it But as a new feature it as a new feature to market and distinguish
white board on the left Every every one of us most draw or favourite animal
standard think about things like intuitive small fairly cheap that's pretty cheap
beginning of such project it's it's very to talk about this would be that would call
scroll push hard on the pen
joke and so if you wanna show something put it in the shared folder
dark a few years ago
channel you can see on the lcd screen what programs
called the smart board
tool training we have two smartboards Then the project
trendy it's two things really are close to each other but at same time
white rat if it's the white rabbit
jury the whole world we can sell
brand independent it doesn't have to matter which brand your tv
soap very straight to afford with the say to print the younger the blind to select pen
red hair so it must be red
camera settings so we don't have or laptops in front of the cameras
discussion about that and a little closing at the end
figured out that was actually the box to impress
watched my big lines were or like mine
mark up some general ideas and then we can plan
sending it over radio waves or bluetooth
