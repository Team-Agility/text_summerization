tvs on remote control and you lost your remote control but maybe you can find with the lights
hard to design a remote control or is it specifically designed to a single device
feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shape
press a button it's like a input for the remote control it and it should be action
remote control or should have a switch on or off but it to use it can sit anywhere in the room in front of the tv and they can control different functionalities of the tv they should be a signal
design a bit more can really do it for children
feature a user would like to have as the compact ness of the car remote
lock like you should be able to lock your remote control
types of remotes which use the video be used to control the function
press one button in one more than it would change the channel
today i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote control
meeting if it is dark so that you can find your remote control if it is dark
buttons and and to me that there should be switched
remote control it to make it usable for more than one device
today that we not many people who don't have a tvd
groups the children issue can be addressed we see shape and we scholars
lead function is probably the question to be addressed here is only with the target group
question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense of any the basic design
messages like they should be a user interface
save electricity like that it should be a battery
source of so the functional requirements Liz muir sport michael
sum it up the target group which is in a sense
favourite channel you want to control the what do you want to go new a new to the tv or you want to have a child cannot you that time
find it so gotta concentrate on the features that help you find
chip which is like a printed the remote control which does all the operations and vice
simple features and they don't take much to our armour just though investment
time at the set for viewing a particular program switching on and off are of particular program according to the user
personal preference that it should be in the shape also include
clock clock of it if you want more features that we can display o'clock
important the thing that we could address our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room
earlier he was mentioned they have to elderly people who have limited function is their fingers and hands
thirty four percent it even more important
animals they are in it or not elephants so they can remember
budget they were looking at the on the whole house
budget they were looking at that the price point we're looking at we should be able to make it work the tvt vcr the stereo was that maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance
design something that's very attractive to children the mommy we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing call
helpful have we looked at the slides at the same time
nation initial stage i should just be open to want to suggestions
end of the floor a simple one it but then you have a another colour
charge of trying to figure out what we should put on those things that i have to try to sell
visit the site have a look at the side
integrated circuit it takes energy from the power source
back in getting next week you're that they're never gonna come back
writing here should be an attractive impulse purchase a twenty five euros
big pile of things that we anybody can throw
case we could probable moulded plastic isn't all that expensive
principle that will be they'll be kinda fun
instruction from higher out of that certain things should not be a considered
closing that they would be lunch break
order to make it really sellable we've got a short knowing curve make it's really intuitive in easy
