important feature i would like to have it might be more would be the speech recognition feature

keyboard the green one is a circuit board on a buck and it's just printing
buy a otherwise recognise the in the television
preferences as far as i'm concerned are we gotta look appealing
display clocks so that people can use it for a long time
designed every year different things are popular
costs less than what you print of the people
mentioned was it should be it should have a very short learning curve
morse code to put that back button and the transistor

movie just do the lab sample sensor speaker
question you can always contact me or or you coach
