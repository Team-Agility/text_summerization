leads us to some personal preferences the remote control
apply the remote control on which you can apply different case covers
shake to older people so they would prefer design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station
imagine that the remote control and you can sell
Elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time
efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station
extra buttons so people are more money
changing channels button on the right side that would certainly You great options for the design of the remote
choose for that option the docking station would can become obsolete
build in a function of which shows the channel or some which the television
button to keep it a simple i want push
Choose for the battery That brings
energy but just a simple battery which you can read a little docking station is just as good a much cheaper
brings is a did it back to the energy
case the supplement and the buttons it really depends on the designer and the chips
docking station and small screen would be are main points of interest
meeting we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design
voice recognition and that will avoid use a lot of energy
top of that the lcd screen would held in making the remote control easier
program it so you got on the left side a little on the right site buttons for shifting of chasing down the channels
buttons on both the left and right side of put the sound
fff first of all we have to see it it is possible to in to use kinetic energy
options we could use the basic normal battery for a six months
display of it it's a just a small
control which would fit in with a wooden cover and plastic
curve is pretty good to put the screen in so the elderly
talk about the energy source we can use the basic battery
advise to bring two editions one with a woodlike colour and maybe feel and one with a grey black and grey
industrial design and user interface designer are going to work
older people prefer the corners to be round
encounter any problems with Choosing channel
difficult to handle and to get in the right shape
phase we're going to discuss today that's the conceptual
brings us to the discussion about their concepts
left and the person's Use a different hand the functions
research indicated that was by far the most important factor
lcd screen like you would have on the most advanced mobile phones
fit the image unless we would start in thirty minutes
Point i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes rsi
swing before you can watch television the solar cells
surveys have indicated that especially wood is a lot more expensive to produce
deployed some trendwatchers to milan and paris to get all the news trends and i've consulted
group we're focusing on the people of sixty eighty year olds customers
increase costs assignation and significantly
inform you buy the trendwatching and then over the past
year mentions the last meeting already I hope you enjoy
supplement we could to of that later a rubber belt like and i slipped
instructions send the body coach
distribute it some more on cats questionnaires
