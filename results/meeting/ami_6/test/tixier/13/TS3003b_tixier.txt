effort and those we can make a remote control
simple manner to put a lot of functions in one in one the remote control
remote control simply don't have a lot of buttons
suggest Let's have a discussion on the roof functions
beneficial to the Design we should make a remote
fifty percent of the People indicated that the remote control
remote control for elderly people are they can think of i wanna subtitles
press a button that pressed it's goes to the chip
eighty because we're going to design know is for people
hard to learn how to operate a tv
forty percent of the market which is above forty
results also indicated that about one corner of the people questioned thought that remote
focus on the on the design So that we can move on to the second then faced the first this phase
er be just use their general functions of the remote control
time use function that's what i like to call
minimum number of buttons the real buttons we have to use rebecca
people need to the teletext for a soda
fancy design easy to learn few buttons on the right places
power button got online and teletext
tv would need a a function where you can actually if you all channel and scroll
workings simple so it's robust
factors that should be include in the design the size
idea to have just a little screen in a way that which explain
general fear of the functions of the device you got a of a pot a part displayed go for power
switch from channel one to like thirty five wanna push the next channel settings buttons
discussion about the new project requirements that's clear
targeting people of forty plus the chance that they will have a tv with internet access
focus on aesthetics designer user interface of it for the taking of functions
buttons we talked about the docking station or d screen
biggest part of the market we wanna reach with our product
addition we did some market research see what the market consists of what ages are involved
focus on elderly people though i have to adapt
tend to spend the money a lot easier
targets because we're going to develop a new product
focus on the age of sixteen to twenty
idea in mind we could make tons of money
infrared to send a signal to the tv
touch screen in the remote control would be preferred
adapt they're not used to using scroll button which is very useful and searching names
minutes for all of it so i suggest let's start with the first presentation
marketing right we can sell this just like i if you've heard about it in the news the elderly mobile phone
tend to have a hard time understanding new devices
channel selection and volume selection but gotta turn on a scale of one to ten for relevancy the power and teletext
greatly increase the production cost but these are just some small factories
real the full upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be that's the past
tech materials the price is going to go sky
till forty five it remains feasible is it also greatly
research in a usability lab we observed
specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach
