suggest Let's have a discussion on the control
fancy remote control
focus on the on the design then but on functionality
simple manner to put a lot of functions in one in one the remote control
effort and those we can make a remote control
internet is also mentions just to go In a function
remote control only to operate a tv there simply not a lot of buttons
beneficial to the Design we should make a remote
fifty percent of the People indicated that the remote control
remote which is a typically made for this market of that people think from That people think that's the device i've looked for although i didn't realise
elderly people indicated that there are remote got lost in the room
remote control for elderly people are they can think of i wanna subtitles
press a button that pressed it's goes to the chip
decision on the control functions which you wanna include and those which we don't wanna include
forty percent of the market which is above forty
minimum number of buttons we have to use rebecca
people need to the teletext for a soda
power button got online and teletext
fancy design easy to learn few buttons on the right places
prof latest but the telephone for elderly people here which tend
addition to this it could rechargeable batteries in the remote
hard to learn how to operate a new control remote control so these are two factors
tv would need a a function where you can actually if you all channel and scroll
hours like on off of the time we've got them plenty of time
workings simple so it's robust
focus on elderly people though i have to adapt
factors that should be included in the design
general fear of the functions of the device you got a of a pot a part displayed go for power
switch from channel one to like thirty five wanna push the next channel settings buttons
focus on aesthetics designer user interface of it for the taking of functions
buttons we talked about the docking station or d screen
discussion about the new project project documents folder
tend to spend the money a lot easier
biggest part of the market
adapt they're not used to using scroll button which is very useful and searching names
pity for the marketing right we can sell this just like i if you've heard about it in the news the elderly mobile phone
screen in the remote control would be preferred
focus on the age of sixteen to twenty
idea in mind we could make tons of money
infrared to send a signal to the tv
greatly increase the production cost but these are just some small factories
minutes for all of it so i suggest let's start with the first presentation
tend to have a hard time understanding new devices
channel selection and volume selection but gotta turn on a scale of one to ten for relevancy the power and teletext
real the full upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be that's the past
tech materials the price is going to go sky
till forty five it remains feasible is it also greatly
research in a usability lab we observed
specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach
