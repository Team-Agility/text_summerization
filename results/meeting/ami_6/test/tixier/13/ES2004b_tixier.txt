decided not to have a look to one of the people of designed
remote control which have the main features Like volume control a challenge changing the channel
cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control
punching into trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user
rubber up so it definitely gonna be for tv and video
people between the age of twenty to thirty five the biggest market
people have used a remote control for say a year and they're not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons
biggest frustrations that people find a second to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier a remote controls are often lost in the room
remote you gotta press a button on top the tv and it beeps
people might want to put it on the mantel piece or whatever it's if it looks attractive
lines to be able to incorporate it quite into the design
control and maybe in japan and then you need to have a small
appeal to sections of the market research at some point of view
fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons
tv to make it as simple as possible and to summarise
number of functions making it simpler it's instead of having lots of things you put in for kate
concept is to have a flipped a part of the main functions
hard because there are times the buttons some countries and small
public male and female all age groups and fifty a points
everyone's got like a big pile of them but now and maybe you system
corporate image should be incorporated into the handset
simple as you can change the state of the tv all other appliances sending a signal
click you can just press a button on the program details
summarise i would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use Rather than having a lot of complex
pay you deal with i have that she doesn't have to go on obligation
user interface design that many and that fashionable aspect of it we might have to change the different market around the world
company it in view too you can incorporate that into the design of the product and then the company
person's most likely to be taken up first of all with the main purchasing power is coming from for a product
punch in new for the features such as i did features that you shop
usual selection methods to get a cross section of the general
flat one it looks like a box like a chocolate
resources and the older age groups to thirty
main components i came up with the power source the battery
called up that table there we are supposed to question
point about them being small and easy to carry
record anyway so if you there's a program on you want to record
hold of it's semi circle in the bottom
tiny little right and lots of linking to summarise
slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for r repetitive strain injury you have a small
attractive to a trendy new york are and what is attractive to a retired says africa
wider range of four audience and we can punch
customer service in the instruction bucks have a look reckon
banana shape thing called a like a boat
mobile phone maybe he might hold down the street but for a remote
easily labelled so that anyone can tie that's a pretty
fair amount i ran out of time want is charged
power and consumers consider i take it with the internet
miss you could put the logo in the colour for the model
head trend is on this may have to be postponed to future
