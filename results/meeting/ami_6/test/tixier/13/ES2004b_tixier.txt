decided not to have a look to one of the people of designed
remote control and try to confuse the user
people between the age of twenty to thirty five the biggest market
people only use about it at ten percent of the buttons
remote you gotta press a button on top the tv and it beeps
lines to be able to incorporate it quite into the design
people might want to put it on the mantel piece or whatever it's if it looks attractive
segment age groups your design are dividing it according to the country's also the market
buttons you just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions
seventy five percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons are gonna pick
conform to What i have a why the form of communication the tvs
number in and it's just a number of different designs inside
summarise i would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use Rather than having a lot of complex
change the state of the tv all other appliances sending a signal
control and maybe in japan and then you need to have a small
corporate image should be incorporated into the handset
appeal to sections of the market research will be needed to focus
proportion of our international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's bit nicer looking current remote
pay you deal with i have that she doesn't have to go on obligation
concept is to have a flipped a part of the main functions
wrap projects the mutation the week and control one hand set for all tv it here Occur
method was like to about brainstorming we did in the last meeting just a couple like the point of view
lost in the room is slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing fifty percent
press a button on the program on you want to record
tend to be a bit hard of the continues you use a general
company it in view too you can incorporate that into the design of the product and then the company
public male and female all age groups and fifty a points
user interface design that many and that fashionable aspect of it we might have to change the different markets around the world
tv to make it as simple as possible and to summarise
flat one it looks like a box with lots of pages
book on top of for rechargeable something on the remote
punch in new for the features such as i did features that you shop
reflect our project that we might Have a bit of you can see dissonance between it more approach it was hands
resources and the older age groups to thirty
main components i came up with the power source the battery
snow extra at the person have to walk to sharpen the highest charge
called up that table there we are supposed to question
slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for r repetitive strain injury you have a small
customer service number Thing that you can phone up and speak
wider range of four audience and we can punch
important or flat the company's image in our product and make fifty
person's most likely to be taken up first of all with the main purchasing power consumption
hold of it's semi circle in the bottom
innovative c shape thing called a like a boat
lacked eighteen last quite a long time want is charged
chocolate that's a string is because it commas
quickly and go over the new project requirements that i missed
problem is that with them eyeball fine you sign for contracts
plastic could do a conch shell or skull optional exterior
head trend is on this may have to be postponed to future
