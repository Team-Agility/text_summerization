stick on button the only thing that has really changed is the colouration of the buttons with a worry too much button on a with a special
Syria maybe if we go rid of like the maybe one of the special colour of silver on your display because you've got effectively a double agn on the on the logo in means that it splits off what you're always from the product
handle the button supplements is just a supplement for all the buttons be made in a different colour was on a button
cost a i had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour was actually i was assuming we had the red apple did we decide against the apple because a lot of work
past see this is it's cheaper to make them a different It's as you got we've made it a special button form on a bone then maybe they could be a different shape
special material rubber case go for rubber button that was rubber wears the rest would be hard plastic
rid of the rubber Case a bit less instead of the corporate identity then the in a sleek plastic Case we knew that point
assuming that all the buttons on the second the panel the hidden away but i'll put all be standard except for the one that appleton that would take care of that i case
kinetic the problem is we have to get used them from there to get it going to twelve point seven was that the price was features we adjust special colours to this point two for profitability in effect
rid of the rubber we put an extra next to see if we can shape or one of the buttons a lemon yellow
restricted just say that you have to design a television remote controls assume that curviness ball in the first one you'd also look to some remote control is and the most fancy thing that you could imagine design
rr button you're thinking of on the other on the other option in a sense i remember that when you look then we've got solar power
sensitive Is it a recogniser product on the website here real reaction there is a pretty high-tech and cutting edge
pick up the switch and just important quickly to change channel or less buttons you got the volume so if it's that obvious that's fine if you're mean the panel any look in each you'd and then you pay a bit more attention
room and innovative and we've got sixteen buttons
incorporate elements of fashion to try to buy
starting if it to do with the rest of the product
Close on the side of the fashion time use remember it has to be under twelve and a half As far as i know that to That took care of the of supplements
product look and feel you got a risk of the spongy feel which was in the time
simple we could do it would be to have the battery To have your sample sensor and sample speaker voice recognition be so overweight thing to have a list of the patches
innovation if you make it more in the in the two of them win these points of the being fancy rather than functional
pretty good at the moment and if and we're going to do stand system the current
finances that we can say we can make that the cost by the production cost remember that was one the first consideration has to be and under and had twelve fifty or two and a half at twelve and a half euros
library or or come back or go and see child lock
sense at the moment we've got a total which we need to reduce the number two year you would change it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements
method is the design team mates Prototype presentation now we just like on the prototype against some criteria just based on the marketing that we need to identify mental one as at the end
desires are the most on this Type company that having the kinetic feature in the voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got to know battery
minimise that one in the top right hand the actual labelling on the individual buttons then the bottom indicates that the power would be more Part of the corporate identity
evaluate that meets aspects that we're looking for from our previous meeting you say that you do this you do that then you call
product so mean And call they said if High definition tvd and Whole ball seven inch that like computer have like a range of products
speech use it they gave me just everything you've written that page
click india so in get out there The finance a three evaluate the design at the top
casing that they're trying to use this software to To demonstrate how you could do the project and i'm not my way for the moment is acting as a computer
corporate image of like a new set of sleek technology lots of saying as as having the logo is frame do in the same way is that what they like black and white or black and silver
write on the street to see easiest way of doing it has to put some notes down the channel files
