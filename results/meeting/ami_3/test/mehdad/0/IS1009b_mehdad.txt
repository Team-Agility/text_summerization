lock like you should be able to lock your remote control so that what they were buttons are presently a child second be like you if you have key kids and all then they'll be sleeping with remote control but maybe you can find out that above the main purpose of our remote is to control the function for television it at the file off the standard remote the students
nervous people who can never press if suppose that i used to lean but the remote remote control and and she or he is pressing the button all at the time then they should be i'll be saying that it did this is not that all action did they can be no action
input and it to transforms into in front runner bits some of the would be it's like but a particular frequency the device like tv or that you can be spent something like that so i remote control for my people are devices
design different remotes for different people want a big pile of things that we anybody can throw
types of remotes which use the video be used to control the functionalities different functionalities of the tv television
today i'm going to talk about the working design how does it work with computers all the time changing
frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or your time is it takes five years to develop
basic design a understand will be the same but the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design of the remote should be in such a way that they should not be in the shop projections so that if a child
bottom buttons also if you want to have more features in your remote floor and then there should be more buttons if there are more buttons will grow differently shape for people of either for children
discuss them with the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features which are user would like to have on their remote
system if a particular channel you want to control the what do you want to go new a new to the tv or you want to have a child cannot you that time
battery it can't be an la and the chip supplied like you have to i like the control it can it can connect your remote control or to a power supply from the electricity they should not be so much small are lots of so the kids
sum it up the target group we have stopped groups the question
findings i found out that and then different site have a look at the top like that design i know so that you can find it so gotta concentrate on the features that help you find
text or buttons which which are there on the old remote control and it goes we can meet or like fruit or cent
vice thing or the chip which is like a printed the remote or a chip on turn on your cti
internet from my research that some extent of electronic entertainment control with something for everyone or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shape
helpful have we looked at the slides at the same time at the set for viewing a particular program switching on and off are of particular program according to the user
parts and it's if somebody wants to get that but round it eta b and then you can said that it can be used as an clock clock of it if you want more features that we can display o'clock then it should be switched off turn up at ten o'clock automatically so that nobody gets translated
specific so that will have a list of things we can cross off not something like the whole house control
question where the that's important the thing that we could address our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room
back to you to help we got the suggestions from that point we're looking at we should be able to make it work the tvt vcr the stereo was that maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance
friendly it should not in a skin disease are some things and the energy by the children and that made a leash but they cannot buy three different remotes they would like to buy
personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t and i've bad for more compact ability
design something that's very attractive to children the mommy we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing point of view be funny the funny shape
end of the floor a simple one that's a stripe the whatever they have as another one in the package and they can go to the store and for few francs or euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours
sites or though will be each of the rrr that side from that they have i got so few point of view is in the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out there will buy for christmas for their child or for the husband
charge of trying to figure out what we should put on those things that i have to try to sell for christmas
mind cells they always say be back in getting next week you're that they're never gonna come back
money extra money because maybe have an integrated circuit we can just definitely fit that region of the circuit city
twenty five euros makes a or present and we want to be an impulse
nation initial stage i should just be open to want to suggestions to come back to the other slide their consulting industrial engineer
hold full screen
electronics and all that's gonna be different is the plastic case we could probable moulded plastic isn't all that expensive
easy that it can be easily identified as a product or for of off the company and that there's no mistake but it could be somebody else was bringing this ad so wanna going to check this year so we not getting too much off track here with with the things you wanna look at these were instruction from higher out of that certain things should not be a considered
