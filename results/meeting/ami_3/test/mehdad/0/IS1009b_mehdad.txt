lock like you should be able to lock your remote control so that what they were buttons are presently a child second be like you if you have key kids and all then they'll be sleeping with remote control so can the remote control
press if suppose that i used to lean but the remote remote control and and she or he is pressing the button all at the time then they should be i'll be saying that it did this is not that all action did they can be no action
types of remotes for different light source which i use which can be used for control the functionalities different functionalities of the tv television
today that we not many people are designing three different remotes for three different categories of people
input and it to transforms into in front runner bits some of the would be it's like but a particular frequency the device like tv or that you can be spent something like that so i remote control for my people are devices
today i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote should be in such a way that they should not be in the shop projections so that if a child
colour so if you want to have less buttons or buttons also if you want to have more features in your remote floor that sends to light up or buttons that are slightly differently shape for people of either for children
remotes which use the video we what are the infrared light already led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television
discuss them with the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features which are user would like to have on their remote
tv or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations that's that should be some button in one more than it would change the channel so that people can change a tactile sensor
battery it can't be an la and the chip supplied like you have to i like the control it can it can connect your remote control or to a power supply from the electricity they should not be so much small are lots of so the kids
lead function is probably the question to be addressed here is only with the target group or sub groups the question be a mute point
important the thing that we could address our last meeting if it is dark so that you can find your remote control and it goes we can meet or like fruit or cent
sum it up the target group and for this one target group we're gonna design
feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shape also include maybe different buttons for the different groups the children issue can be addressed we see shape and we scholars
vice thing or the chip which is like a printed the remote or a chip on turn on your cti
findings i found out that and then different site have a look at the top like that design i know so that you can find
helpful have we looked at the slides at the same time at the set for viewing a particular program switching on and off are of particular program according to the user
parts and it's if somebody wants to get that but round it eta b and then you can said that it can be used as an clock clock of it if you want more features that we can display o'clock then it should be switched off turn up at ten o'clock automatically so that nobody gets translated
system if a particular channel does not to be you would buy a particular phone or upset in each then that begins can do a lot of that particular channel so that's children not to and i don't bus
internet from my research that some extent of electronic entertainment control should be possible at the budget they were looking at the on the whole house idea
budget they were looking at that the price point we're looking at we should be able to make it work the tvt vcr the stereo was that maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance
pry are helping with prioritising of of the features and they don't take much to our armour just though investment
design something that's very attractive to children the mommy we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing call
end of the floor a simple one that's a stripe the whatever they have as another one in the package and they can go to the store and for few francs or euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours
mind cells they always say be back in getting next week you're that they're never gonna come back
personal preferences in this project or are we really have to concentrate on this is all that is the selling point the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase
money extra money because maybe have an integrated circuit we can just definitely fit that region of the circuit city
nation initial stage i should just be open to want to suggestions to come back to the other slide their consulting industrial engineer
frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or your time is not o'clock on the screen you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute
sites or though will be each of the rrr that side from that they have i got so few point of view is in the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out there will buy for christmas for their child or for the husband
twenty five euros makes a or present and we want to be an impulse
electronics and all that's gonna be different is the plastic case we could probable moulded plastic isn't all that expensive
corporate image is being maintained and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product or for of off the company and that there's no mistake but it could be somebody else was bringing this ad so wanna going to check
check this year so we not getting too much off track here with with the things you wanna look at these were instruction from higher out of that certain things should not be a considered
