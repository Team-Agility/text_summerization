time i'm going to concentrate more on the components of component we should all be have in the remote control or is that a sister
extra features like lead buttons make it then you press a button that's a cute and the button and it will send some signals through the wires and then at the chip
uid is supposed to come up with a user interface design i would give more emphasis on the interface type supplements
transistor that is the use of transistor be which we use in the remote control it's important but do you do is raise are loose
types of feature buttons you can have a new but there were taught at the lower end
lake colby have a design but before we have seen some a few things like that instead of button and the individual button has it's a one more school
remotes which are different and shape and colour of the picture of the contrast sharpness brightness of the picture
colours blue red green so we have to use a some a call on the component components have all those things that could chip there which is having a team games and also our capacity of capacity or three or sisters and also would resonate
message us could be switch on off mess age or switch to next channel if we don't want to see this touch and then we can stop it to the fault standard always see worse
prefer it's would be sp or to incorporate speech recognises bits for a response to use this voice recogniser click it has it's one of those issues
phase the two of you no and fancy in have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay
control it if it is not the fish and then everything but it's going to be like a then if it's less efficient so it you should be should have a highly sophisticated one because it's like the heart a child lock
remote can be it can be our design which can have the y so they could deny is as you can record your own voice so i would like to have a close a new data
inside and the tv can see the infrared light and seeing the signal and it will send it to the ed and which translates the signal signals to the be integrated circuit
keyboard the green one is a circuit board in a remote control
school suppose that use it has pressed a button one then it would have a spare the circuit will generate a specific morse code has to be amplified but the transistor
suddenly if if you were he gets a telephone call and if you want he doesn't want to switch on it to recognise my wise and the switch to the mind johno to the tv but you can read use the sound
important feature i would like to have it might be more would be the speech recognition feature would be a supplement
agreement that's that what we discussed last time to sell it for should be for other people can prove i look at their favourite to a program on the right from the remote
designed every year different things are popular
technical manager have as then said that she feels it should have a chip and the me that we have the scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range it for school pros
building a some steak use some of those are cute and also wires it's better to go for printing
morning like around eight o'clock on want to see the news in the television
time so in that way we can cut the cost but it yet that we have to me the battery can be should be need not go for our high-performance battery even if it is a mobile
meeting will be in thirty minutes to the end of the meeting is the concept of the remote
small children that equip and they're watching the french program and you would like to have a subtitles in english that they should be a channel which can read that this may can use them in the television so that the user can see the the subtitles on the screen
mind that the that is i'm interested in what the competition is doing and wanna see how we can make our sauce different from the competition
components of the concept is the energy source to be all for the basic battery orange and use a hard dynamo i kinda provision of energy
presentations but as far as a decision and the marketing expert has to present
narrower selection down to one and two things that we're gonna say are really great about our new product can be the delivered into different cases
addition to that to make it to sell the marketing manager who wishes that it's be very attractive the customers
multipurpose use it can be used for tv can be used for cable satellite it can be used for vcr dvds and audio
movie just do the lab sample sensor speaker
receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches
research this you have an update fruit and vegetables it's a really popular and you were tired of hard plastic so that it can be struck
