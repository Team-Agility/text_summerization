extra features like lead buttons make it then you press a button that's a cute and the button and it will send some signals through the wires and then at the chip
case is and card flats that of a vc usually or not my remote control it's important but do you do is raise are loose
uid is supposed to come up with a user interface design i would give more emphasis on the interface how the remote which child can use this is user-friendly
sake you would sell and they need the button and that should get this can be used for increasing or decreasing the wall
time i'm going to concentrate more on the components of component we should all be have in the remote control or is that a sister
User interface which can be created
electric electricity saving feature i would like to have it might be more would be the speech recognition feature buttons you can have a new but there were taught at the lower end
buttons which can control features like the carlo colour of the picture of the contrast sharpness brightness of the picture
school suppose that use it has pressed a button one then it would have a spare the circuit will generate a specific morse code has to be amplified but the transistor that is the use of transistor be which we use in the remote control it will amplify
interface a lot of the remote can be it can be our design which can have the y so they could deny is as you can record your own voice so i would like to have a close a new data
school pros we have to go for that sophisticated and all that you feel complete chip and also it's better be go for the ordinary buttons
components have all those things that could chip there which is having a team games and also our capacity of capacity or three or sisters and also would resonate
control it if it is not the fish and then everything but it's going to be like a then if it's less efficient so it you should be should have a highly sophisticated one because it's like the heart a child lock
inside and the tv can see the infrared light and seeing the signal and it will send it to the ed and which translates the signal signals to the be integrated circuit
keyboard the green one is a circuit board in a remote control
lake colby have a design but before we have seen some a few things like that instead of buttons are that in this small compact for personal favourite was it would be t shaped
buy a otherwise recognise the in the television
scroll-wheel pushbutton can you can achieve scrolling by repeated be pushing a button requires a simple chip and the me that we have the scroll it which we used to do before ten years
people are there's too many great feature is the consumer just gets confused
eyes i'd spend a lot of time to sell it for should be for other people can prove i look at their favourite to a program on the right from the remote
general The idea is that it should be something that it's not difficult to recognise which button is for what function
building a some steak use some of those are cute and also wires it's better to go for printing
meeting will be in thirty minutes to the end of the meeting or anything like that i try to notice what remote controls people
message us could be switch on off mess age or switch to next channel and i say it was that thing that john lewis a smidgen want to a particular channel if we don't want to see this touch and then we can stop it to the fault standard always see worse
speech recognition feature would be a supplement for her speech recogniser click it has it's one of those issues
mind that the that is i'm interested in what the competition is doing and wanna see how we can make our sauce different from the competition so i've really be looking at the press and the ads that are out there for a remote control or s eyes
watching the french programme and you would like to have a subtitles in english that they should be a channel which can read that this may can use them in the television so that the user can see the the subtitles on the screen
components of the concept is the energy source to be all for the basic battery orange and use a hard dynamo i kinda provision of energy
rechargeable battery can be should be need not go for our high-performance battery even if it is a mobile
narrower selection down to one and two things that we're gonna say are really great about our new product can be the delivered into different cases
presentations but as far as a decision and the marketing expert has to present
suddenly if if you were he gets a telephone call and if you want he doesn't want to switch on the at tv can be used for cable satellite it can be used for vcr dvds and audio
