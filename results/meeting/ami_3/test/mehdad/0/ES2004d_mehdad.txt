criteria any the fancy look-and-feel how do we feel about this prototype model relating to find a way of raising the couch
moved away from our much loved idea of the kind battery are not gonna say i'm not getting this is about to buy a car shaped remote control
everybody's going to evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information collection we can go ahead and i could use this as a prototype design but to the criteria that we call from our market research basis of that of these evaluation is really for as a team to a value we if we have no got a product if it was actually If the if we'd seen the marketing the fall the initial specification
invite your presentation with all the other control if you're someone who's that thing sitting like that we found so many people get hurt you minimise that such a small device
fashion trends that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours the design should minimise rsi e and easy to locate
black and white touch screen you can see that would be self And you say it's it would be sold in set into the top and the buttons like that for volume up and down channel up and down power on and off and to things to that affect
findings that we came up with just to recap are here at the criteria that i've just mentioned a call that's like a cop
cheap so it has something like what you chance that where is the remote and Ellis shall back
innovations another people want in a model of the for the really happy
plastic body with a as a standard colour was why all like all a light plane but the changeable fat faces with that allow you to get any any one of the number of colours the it's false customers
preliminary of rating high end of the upper end of this go ahead with that i really doubt
decided on the inside we could do possibly either have some sold that sold a logo on it and say maybe an engraving of the later on the top section on the bottom sections
feel about this we've got our got the highest reading of meeting the specifications that's definitely true for two or three six criteria that we want in this remote control or a fancy look-and-feel technological innovation it should be easy to use it should incorporate car and fashion trends and the with the two main
buttons with a combination of lcd and rubber as the rubber case materials could be soft rubbery changeable
account Overheads Like arts being paid thing and the heating for the building do you think our party increase everything all the costs no it's it's going to be feasible cost-wise
slightly on the list of to use voice recognition software interacts i until we can find out more about the cost
size we go it's quite small but with a minor
finally last but not least easy to hold a search resume that also be quite cheap
terribly low it's closer and you troll is for the minimise the issue of repetitive strain injury Do we feel on the basis of our technology rr capabilities we could actually do much more to minimise
battery anymore for that type of phone because the phones like every I want to see you in your lunch like that and new for television
pen it would be facing the tv Some this in the other really more tvs use this the same infrared medium
include stop it delegating it in my role as project team or any project
discussed that we haven't really come up with anything that We stopped feasible which is that we've talked about point five is it twelve point new one every year
decided to use the kinetic cells
smart and you've just got this big chunk of like saying say in your coffee table
ninety nine know i'm interfering with the lose the whole look of the product coming up but a giving we have in dealing with la's

data and the infrared And centre would be on the on one of the u but they bottom line adjust to the front
sample sent sample speaker
liza would need to separate pcb still be joined at the hinge three some sort labelling
bounce off each other i necessarily sell at twenty five times to use Twenty five percent
