main idea of the whole thing is to say use you just press down on the rubber buttons so you can see wall the button which the set
addressed the issue of for how to locate the remote control of the controls
talk about people who live in basements that's just not that many people but there are people so i watch tv in the night
simply space like that so you can have the than the size or is it just one size or we would have to fit the design
image of all in my head if something shape like that maybe about that size made of plastic fits into the palm of a hard rubber cover that goes over the look at the spongy feel
produce the if they used time we be get feedback from the design of the edge components
form of a it's a small a cell which it charge and say and the side the size of a watch i watch battery and to sell a charging
discussed last meeting there should be easy to find out of this led a in the sequence of log on and off busts
end like marketing team say do people need trendy they'll board of back
charge a remote wouldn't be a big but if remotes away is good for a round
flip screen the top one is gonna be the lcd in the palm one that's gonna be the rubber or less buttons on the screen you could you bake it you could fit the problem with it is that it's flat and so you can't be lots
rubber i suppose spongy apart from that we're just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours and it's a used just by charging the colour of your colour the skin or the wheel

decided it's on it leaving out the voice recognition that was the main
methods we used to decide on Current trends and so one market trends that we did your traditional are usual market research it's not thing that people to for the marketing department they want something to do with fruits i wouldn't say the design

point out that the first of those findings fancy look and feel rather than the current functional look-and-feel is d most important but it's there it in order of preference to the subject we looked into the availability of some of the materials
mention that could be incorporate the image of the company logo
top of a look at it you button which are like volume or channel changing on could be on the pointing device you put on key is the one he's just sitting on the run

car engine meeting we spoke about a beeper thing that we should talk
picture he shows what are the standard models all for the calculator they're quite the quite they can they all play with the identical
