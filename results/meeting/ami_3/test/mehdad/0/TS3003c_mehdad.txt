efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station and small screen would be are main points of interest
Changing channels button on the right side that would certainly You great options for the design of the remote
shake to older people so they would prefer design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station
button to keep it a simple i want push doubleclick it so you get the excess subtitles for people which can of walk and we small

build in a function of which shows the sound or some which the television
fff first of all we have to see it it is possible to in to use kinetic energy
talk about the energy source we can use the basic battery for a six months
