advance because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control the remote control the I found some something about speech recognition
Changing channels button on the right side that would certainly You great options for the design of the remote
efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station and small screen would be are main points of interest
Elderly people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control and at the same time
watch which you just shake your remote and then it powers
shake to older people so they would prefer design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station
project and Make a good design that's important the corporate design image is going to be in the remote
build in a function of which shows the sound or some which the television
button to keep it a simple i want push doubleclick it so you get the excess subtitles for people which can of walk and we small
brings us to the discussion about their concepts
discard the voice recognition and that will avoid use a lot of energy
program it so you got on the left side a little on the right site buttons we have to use the on off sound higher or lower the numbers zero to nine and that buttons and more again but one button for shifting percent i like it and channel or for putting it out sounds you can just give a sign say sound
top of that the lcd screen like you would have on the most advanced mobile phones
fancy with either the would cover the remote control which would fit in with a wooden cover and plastic or rubber belt like and i slipped
energy source we can use the basic normal battery for a six months
fff first of all we have to see it it is possible to in to use kinetic energy source
channels also we want to use a little d display of it it's a just a small display
Innovativeness was about half of half as important as the fancy design line
curve is pretty good to put the screen in so the elderly
advise to bring two editions one with a woodlike colour and maybe feel and one with a grey black and grey
points of interest In this meeting we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design that's important
industrial design and user interface designer are going to work
inform you buy the trendwatching and then over the past
pretty big influence or production costs and image will give you Little bit of an impression about the look and feel That the remote
deployed some trendwatchers to milan and paris to get all the news trends and i've consulted advise that it should be the remote control on the docking station should be telephone shape so you could imagine
fit the image unless we would start in thirty minutes
Point i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes rsi
mobile phones so like the nokia mobile phones when you can't change the case
surveys have indicated that especially wood is Be material for all the people
instructions send the body coach
problem that left and the person's Use a different hand the functions
group we're focusing on the people of sixty eighty year old this is These factors are slightly more equal
trend watch a year show showed it people like wood but it raised the price
year mentions the last meeting already I hope you enjoy
distribute it some more on cats questionnaires
