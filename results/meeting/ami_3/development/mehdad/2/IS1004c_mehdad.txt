technology we need to the remote control
bowl a job or button if you press the button there are that are more to start beeping so with the remote base that looks like a banana which few buttons i have to be at some point it has to a circuit board
user wants to help control more than one device want to control more than one device from the same remote you do need my income like we need the book then control so i was all the idea that we can have to power source for the remote buying
fits in the hand and you had a lot of so phase two The for the control to be the shape of a fruit upload banana Shaped object
functionality is just a couple scroll-wheels not button it's hard to get so many button but push technology for channel selection volume control and they need exposing these are the three scroll
player the preference of the users out like this then they don't want to have one remote control a thing which a user should it should be already p define
hold like the way you the end of the banana you wanna of holders may you may be one of the whole like a gun know and you don't have to point toward the fall
findings is uses would be really interested in a look at the doing to find out what's it even if it wasn't a recharging station even if they didn't have to buy batteries that rechargeable batteries so all the period of car investigation on the outside a cat
bite the things that by nine that and the base what having an a base station is nothing more just it's that by which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket
powerful are powered by a man though it's a device on the fruit or you want to some like fruit but a different fruit for kids
conversation with the coffee machine that that with producing is you can say good morning how would you like a coffee
rising is a factor for us that so we'll go for the regular chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana that advanced chip
plastic as a thing is that most appropriate one it'll ring the cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production components
technology that we can add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech since the since it's speech not really speech recognition is even if we can do it it's not really appropriate for a television and running
important to have two scroll-wheels because you want one for the channel we also want one for the volume up volume is it's it's very handy for it to have the instant feedback and response
received an email i'll and lunchtime they know that the bring in mind to the technology division has developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit
unique problem with television's is that if you have this got this scroll-wheel for the television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll and then just ways that station
Twenty five twelve point without worrying too much about how to develop
basis a extra for the functionality is such as the wheels the speaker you need so that in on the list but the device like bci dvd players which are usually a touch with the tv
find more interesting more important needs a fancy look-and-feel instead of a instead of the car and The car and train which was for the functional look and feel so old now More more core aspect not more hard core that aspect rather than a devise ways to many phones times on many buttons
soundtrack for the kid is the design of the hand a hundred
house and now you don't want the traditional uses we can have the pushbuttons so that they don't feel the and i needed list
combination just to train it's not the law and channel four hundred channels you have to be a tool to recognise
importance from leicester more important is that People or nineteen ninety five percent of young people are worse
real recognise i he was but he was in a set not like a freight you train it for a certain for a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back the phrase in response
eugene In the eighties and he back to the minutes of the last meeting we should take a decision on that point
speaker is actually on the chip then if it's too far away from a the casing was the casing is too thick then you may not hear is concerned are we can have some gap so you'd have to worry too much about the case been broken is the inside
city's would not be possible to implement it for the next prototype
cells and the lighting conditions are good that can be useful it'd be pretty in a week
completely to forget about the lcd has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out so it's the basic
spend but charge idea we've had we had doing these presentations just to draw some sketch about so which would be the pro the final product and that were part
shape if you'd and not be out the door probably you may as do it in a style as way that just looks a bit more twenty first century route and sixties and seventies
thin veneer of wood be done in and all those things but plastic you can have the book but the side not the materials we cannot that the book
set it that's a switch with the double curve would actually menu and you could like drawer something on on the whiteboard
microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big deal
