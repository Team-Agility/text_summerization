work they cannot work with double curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate
piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular an advanced functions we can keep with a simple a chip which is a bit cheaper
customers specifically ask for the spongy feel of the material has to be spongy
colouring is important and soft materials
previews i deserve voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
older group a step further dark colours simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint
talk about all the different components wire in this design and it's too dull
walls the reef like the infrared device control and talking to it but it still need to Point i would like to some issues that would like to point
forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic cover with the rubber finishing this is what's on the edge what you feel
colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
grey in yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours are great and yellow
suggest we use the sensor sample the sample sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip i fault
watching tv when you have to make some energy supply at the very little amount of kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it's against the wall
fruit and vegetables are important but innovation is more important than Ease of use for the our target group
latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cell solution for the energy source is the battery and the solar

uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
cable go back in thirty minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
afraid is not possible to print a picture or the size
talk with our manufacturing division is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
