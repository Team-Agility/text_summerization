sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control are a fairly standard this requirements when the users
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy going to the user interface that isn't too complicated
imagine just it is an electronic device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
appeals to younger people maybe people who have problems with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons that they have offered to them on the remote
includes an emphasis on making the infrared very functional requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled That extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design of the remote control
suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different at the types of user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people don't wanna be changing
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and that might be older people
Space is similar to a very basic weapons you have like you have number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
importantly though eighty percent of that they would be willing to pick up the remote all they want like an upgrade
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume changing the channel settings
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicate like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
combination of electrical work and then the other things that are brought in to make it work design they need to be figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
sense we're gonna have to aim for a design which is fairly conventional in design it's gonna be crucial
age so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise
focusing on the designers people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
question earlier on whether this is going to be to for television dv or in it that are just a television that or adjust
talk about our functions and our target group that means that is very few we need to each group
components that we find here are the energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data and presents a while without strips gathering
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d data is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
economic we need to find a way of striking a balance between features and price
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
fifty percent of the people mention something called rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
instruction manual it comes at the end that's and hot because of the combination
price limit of the twelve and a half euro to produce
Switch the quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
