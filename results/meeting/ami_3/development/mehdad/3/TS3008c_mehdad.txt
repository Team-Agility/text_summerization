remote control can lie on the table for a date and then you push a button on the in the remote controls in a look at two colours
catch colours fruit and vegetables it has to be colourful
talk about the components of a remote control the case the properties of material we have to choose
harder but also on the colours are you are many colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour look like it the plastic mold is in one colour and thus those cushion pets around it are in another colour set
telling me that when we build a remote control of of plastic or rubber the buttons has to be solid two and the material and then the rubber double curved case is is it a three dimensional curve in the design
fire i was thinking about the of the we still want the joystick if that's a good idea of maybe is a little bit Too much for twelve and a half Abduction
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station at the bottom
properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material it was a good idea to use the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights
possibility i i looked upon was the lcd display on that we do lots of information
programs you can zap to them with the page page down button skip the volume buttons but that goes to that they have to be large buttons sizes and i'm not or if they have to be ba or just small
puts an extra x and on the simplicity of our remotes to make these two most basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons like that and to control that's lcd
resembles the design for a greater resemblance but with new with new colours
spongy thing already comes for in the in the cushions pets and things on this side
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people were a little bit crazy in one maybe want a little younger design and the them because i do that it dark colours simple recognisable shapes
image which is it's symbolises the idea of fruit and vegetables in christ stick with the remote control
thousand and four you can't put something on the market which is on the ground
email with a with an remote control and you want to retrieve it and the base station is also off the shelf and even the speaker and wireless retriever are all available in our company
energy source i've got a lot of possibilities And lcd was a possibility for the remote control
start with the technical function it's aurora discuss it on the sides
war after to give it to do the soft things and titanium nowadays is way more often used them plastic A screen on top of it isn't for mobile
remind like takes place of the of of specifics piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity thing is just the shape should be for today this is fruit just round it's always fun to have something take a plastic
Drawl really nicely of the best we can put the logo and all that back
colour lcd which is really pretty trendy but i don't think it will be too expensive
time you would have teletext and the menu nowadays to access the screen settings
technical part and the material you are mentioned in your personal preferences
tv guide only for the channel with that we were for programs
drop it if you drop it back to the costs again but we get a bill but pretty cheap design to see if they within our limits of twenty five euros
sell and then tie a title for programme or at least at a quite large part of the rc The up and the upper part or whatever it's it's not use wood buttons
skip the house as easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple electronic all chip is available with the led transmission or a transmitter
colours is very important because it has to be flash a bit and that is a an doesn't have to be in weighing day when you're gonna something's
radios and tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
ia is still don't have any information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
gotta find a balance of the minutes are very hard to read somewhere that i've got some fate fees
emission know it's like more phone row ball and it adds
switch from softer works it's also too much to the lawn wanna spend
