expensive they're a lot of expensive remote control are used by more than one person's
brought new technologies for young people are we gonna have what i was internet connection of the remote see that see a remote control
remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech recognition system as a wide and really quite a microphone also to be sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find
talk about price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
channels that you two digit numbers and you have to press a special button is important but also it the number of buttons
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen you just scroll for that program rubber band to a channel numbers easily
people want to be l to find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
channel than a one i what i use a remote control does is it just change that change the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad
red so if you go to the market and you say that buttons that they're the people it is and on top
feed the targets in front of cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big difference Between the them the first know base unit they can also receive signals of wills the television where you can say change the lighting in the room and that cords out of stand-by then for a device to the receiver
sitting in between the video input to the tv or we have control of the tv on to the remote controller can bring out menu on but our company's tvs
mobile phones are you don't use you don't remember people's fun be you remember the name and you're fine and then so this would be pretty a pretty wide range of remote controls on ep means talk on which is a customer know written review side
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons but what each of those buttons does something different in a different context
programme you could have a start time corporate to do with the remote control you start time all the programs
main formations on the television remote that was universal remotes out on the market no work it does work was supposed to work on and so on the working design issues
relation to know you would be cheaper than the lcd and speech record
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euro because for twenty five euro we can really do with that but the very basic remote control
problem means then the user interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology switch at existing
focus more on the internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special so you have man
train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press the press the button to talk and the tvt v set
question is to you open about this cd screen which helps when you using multiple devices i suppose because you can have multiple functions which have a couple of the round buttons down to a minimum but not quite that interfere with the functionality of the device
functional requirements and especially for the For the user requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
seoul extend past the hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should be similar to the traditional
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting you have the task you have to work
map put it in the problem message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting there on the remote control
forces you had a company which is putting the fashion in electronics
master a very easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
people to use on line which a case of by speaking
sell the potential of the device in use a potentially you can then do a look like change the lights and i close the windows what about the heating
electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
scd e still on this get used to open to discussion
