technical issues which i would like to present do you before we start the discussion
sense that remote it should work on different tvs
consists of three different design stages mean that we do some individual work prepare and then and need to discuss are The for the ring
find more goals for the product we're going to develop
discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how was it should function and all those things the market interest in more than one country

financial part of this project implicates there's not going to be a high end product that cost price is very low
basis of the painting on the button or the blank button that are applicable at that moment
