complicated but it could increase the popularity of the remote control so we are that it'll just be for the tvs
controls with dvd vcr that thing would really complicated design of the remote control we've decided not to include them and make it a specific just a specific television function remote controls for older and chi minh devices
eighty percent of users would spend money on a remote control would look fancy current remote controls
design thing for now because or try to do so much that if we can make a unique user-friendly that that is also a lot of also on multifunctional we're gonna go over budget
design we want to know people want gotta turn on the tv with the remote control
field of research fit be if it's to have a remote control users and some internet research
seventy five percent didn't specify the feel of them are fun and neutral eighty percent of users of remote controls find them ugly which is a quite a significant
infrared will actually be sent through the chip to Be received by the chip on television set I taking inspiration from although similar designed built rank up with a directional trendy remote control which is celp or international
array shows time or obtainable as we have less function on the side of things to include in the design of the apparatus is the fact the apparatus
large percentage of the public would pay extra for voice rec voice recognition on the remote control
discussion on what we want This design to look like i have to see some information from the management that will fact some of our decisions so it's out of our hands at this point
signing up and train on television timetables what's on now what's on that on every Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average four times an hour and as about high relevance of three channel settings
bite for the purposes of this meeting i wasn't offered a like a type of logo what colour so if i could be some more on the design so we can be recognisable
percent of remote control person said they zap a lot zapping meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of a design
figure out what age group we're targeting young adults it looks like something that would pay
multi function controls can be difficult to use as a lot shape of buttons which we're all familiar with when we using a mobile phone mickey
users found was that ten of ten fifteen seconds retouchable and after a touch
raise what's the energy source it could be a battery power thing lights up then it gives the thing close of you have all the lights off in your living room you'll be all temporally
product for as long as they felt that they wanted it and then once they contributed then that company this product responsibility for all the companies are coming up with make new designs
lcd screen or a remote control would be that furthering that problem
Channel changers that a lot of the number game rub down if they're printed on the button that you press the menu at the menu
start to get a new tv set each and all the time all not usable they might be like Bill that's going to scrap metal
materials which would just i'm taking the glow during the day in and as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark you put the real reaction some ball at school in the dark and then it would be constantly put rice
interestingly enough twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount that would are willing to spend remote control like their priorities
sellable just because it's more compatible with our a wider range of television devices it and older generations we should be catering
guest as for my findings looks that one minimise a balance we're not gonna make them actually larger
week me possibly to incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers and cells and be made out of some the dark material
company could than just use that make use of this shape memory i know it is that they don't need to be manually the be constructed
produce have coffee machine the functional side of things we found out that while from a previous meeting we decided that there's certain points do make a product unique
selling adhesive that you could x to come to the back of any set that would be not very intrusive
scrap metal something like the case if it's scratch does anyone wants we use it but you might be able to market with fashionable products
bart simpson face plates end of this to start off with three in if we had a big then we can add
reach a decision on that right now because we need to investigate the financial implications
screen that's holding something together could expand then it would force all the components that part that it's woods allow all the other parts to be separated and some could be we used some could be recycled
