hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
lots of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional button to switch off in case you get bored
skin on screen menu of your channel surfing a scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the television send information back to the remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel
intrigued by the idea of the scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
decided on like a simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip depending
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
tend to watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv and the button to changing the brightness on trying to see it happening
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time i am imagining
round remote instead of like a rubber button down one like in terms of holding it like that so if she to a fruit and vegetables have to haul
double curved is like like two sides that curve gonna make one curve of a case we could do a flat which flat case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved case or it maybe even a double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
sit there and stand control the television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end up with the device going to work together on a model using modelling clay
concept of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface and we'll come back to the chip
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery although there are slight complications with solar battery
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
fun doing it components design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts panel close
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
related to this but of latex cases that it's hard to cover with the latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
minute or if you the minutes left of the meeting
find a way to protect the circuit board
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look and feel and as these are range the top one is double important
designer of our real reaction company that i there are what we have to stress fashion watchers in paris and milan comments on some things that are gonna be go on this year
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre
