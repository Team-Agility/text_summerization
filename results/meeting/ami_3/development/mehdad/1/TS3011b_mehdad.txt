design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
easy to find the remote control is just a function of remote control
easier way of a round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button what's which can be press in for directions instead of a stake
add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to switch to to channels when you have something and channel four n something on channel switching
important button And there are lots of people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control
include other in a stiff Functions decide it and our target audience
functions and the money that we can say from that we should use for having a design and thinking about the user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
channel selection is the most important or volume selection and the teletext
home station for base station next a tv set would have such a device you would have to walk you tv
buttons like that which are easy to use we my coat rack
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons you have that's the cheaper that the chip or in one of the circuit board will become even more cheap
device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find the finding function
expensive and they're hard to implement this a function and can be implemented in in our design will become more complicated
restriction the characteristics of clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound from other sounds which aren't exactly the same from the point if you all from remote control
focusing on young people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
problem is it but it depends on the decisions disease up in this since it's the best and makes about the voice recognition the data
important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people than less than forty years
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost and things like that battery lifetime energy save another advantage
personal preference where ease of that use remote control
user interface connect to chip which is connected to the sender which generates
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques and the user friendliness
decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume and the programme one and some fancy light and techniques blinking lights and all that fancy
user friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten percent we Want to sell
cell phone just one like in the device which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries
generates a few times within that a certain period of time to perform are individual work i have no time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
goal was a boston move you would like to start
top goal of this meeting is to reach call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product on the target group and the functions of the remote control
older you might want to constrain that portion is forty percent of the market would respond to a simple
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
