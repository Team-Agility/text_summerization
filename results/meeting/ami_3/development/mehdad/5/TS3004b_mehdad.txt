create a round remote control eight percent use would spend more money when a remote control would look look fancy
period of an five seconds to press a button and that know for elderly people to look one to press the one that circuit it's clothes
closing that certain circuit gets close by pressing the button the like a switch
points we had last meeting was should be you universal Remote control you need that one button that has to stripes
special all the plo eight people might be bigger buttons those buttons
lose about ninety percent of those options of teletext is become outdated since the popularity of internet
coach and it should be a tv remote control especially when you only have tv function
screen on read through green if you push a button to go to the next one or two ago could prove
normal be put in the simple is to use to send the standards So standardise the methods like a know remote controls
problem to because you have to be fast enough maybe the elderly people what they use what they want on remote control
simple because of the rid the elderly people so we need to keep it simple
point is if we made make remote control for only television it's hard to sell it for twenty five euros
telephone i never use those buttons to call your remote control with the beeps
divide between functions you often used like maybe switch channels and volume and that things and the menu button
fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent on the top ten normally you can press
seventy five per cent of users find out what people use maybe just use questionnaires on the internet
hard to remember if i press that button it goes to that channel connects to what favourite
functions i could think of volume channels the basic a call that number for the more nothing but only the numbers anything do if you press
recognition about you said one and the television dvd players t real and vcr had a question
stand out unique we have the design is most important you can do integrate that volume and previous
fits at the what time if you set about the older people want to spend their money
press something that lights up everything light not led light emitting diode is producing normal one also a normal flashing lights
live in the centre of the room that's exactly what we said about maybe a home station for for it to to recharge the batteries
idea that can be done by just could change changing the spectrum all the time to learn how to use are the new remote control
finally have a conclusion that younger people in or a nature for forty five for more interested in new features
configuring the spectrum just chip sends out that's our to the infrared bulb
reading on a page remote control just sends come on space six months to to television
work them and does it have to work only in english or in dutch
fallen off to take the efforts to design something with the speech recognition you can just throw
required because it like in a mobile phone the phone usability
sixty five persons the city of persons of the users said they zap
circuit as close to produce is the pattern Like a morse code
optional like we discussed like ipod different colours you can choose blue or yellow
motto we are a reference to for our our style be we this is so difficult a difficulty made it make it a very special product cost is that the twelve and a half
product should reach a new market this custom and our do you wanna forty so it should be flashy
