users using a remote their own remote controls all subjective
brings energy going to the user interfaces controlling the chip
personally what i want from a remote control is a device
people are only using ten percent of the buttons
technical functions design presentation and the functional requirements that people satisfied
designing the user interface is for this product
converts electrical energy source people don't wanna be changing
lots of buttons and the relevant the polls buttons hired
weapons you have like you have numbers and sports colours
money to buy a new remote and that ties
people are so is that like change channel changing the volume
complicated like program your television and the power which complicate
parts of the working design presentation i have a pet
frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design
older people didn't really care for voice recognition
people specified problem right now is that people's desires and needs focusing
clear idea of an lcd screen was brought
tv that's just impossible to use or maybe broke
disadvantages you can't use it say to freeze the television
talk about our functions and our target group
battery and that that the chip takes the data
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
bring the data to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
find out find a balance between features and price
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple
Sit simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics
fifty percent of the people mention that was the biggest
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
coffee at the end user is gonna want from this product
price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce
Switch the quality a quality of the chair
