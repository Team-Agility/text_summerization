decision on the remote control should be look fancy
remote control has no way or in the settings menu or just you just wanted to know the volume
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
work with the lcd screen was a rather small
colours will be easier to do in colour
meets more the young people than older people
called like what's the trends from past years
hand there and then you want touch the screen
button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons
rubber rubber is still the rubber isn't fancy
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
screen they don't need that big difference between young
larger it's not really on scale then to work an option
called cults settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu
young people they liked fruity colours like red yellow
hard part of this or softer rubber should be soft
easy choose people something like that Like the ipod do something with the round squares simple
remembered and menu to go back from the floor
change a scroll with the menu to look up some some channels on your television
plain normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
colour titanium or you have to pay chip
user interface are also some questions about the design
square shape sit around got on the round corners what's square
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
volume we should also be enough for easy
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium
point we already decided that on the previous meeting
chip on print think cases are points my coach
time we have forty minutes or thirty minutes of forty
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
question and three seconds later you say the answer
slow you can make a versus the microphone for the speech recognition
show some points on which we it should take a decision
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
prepared a little presentation will we on your side
