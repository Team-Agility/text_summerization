important thing people like to last year was that the remote control should be look fancy
remote control has no way or in the settings menu or just you just wanted to know the volume
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
reacting projecting the buttons on the lcd screen it right and you can draw
pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours will be easier to do in colour
meets more the young people can see it because it is the unique
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly people
hand there and then you want touch the screen
radio button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons
wood rubber rubber that makes it easy to to tune that's it's of colour
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
screen they don't need that big difference between young people fresh exciting and all people
larger it's not really on scale then to work an option for mount station
options is the settings of the remote enough to tv and that a thing called cults settings
young people they liked fruity colours like reading brown light out dark red yellow
hard part of this or softer rubber is the best suits poll up material
easy choose people something like that Like the ipod do something with the round squares simple
tie That what you'd like to do on the screen is want to go back
change a scroll with the menu to look up some some channels on your television
printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip
noticed that be in this file design or the user interface and the buttons
shapes it is something between the square shape sit around got on the round corners what's square
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
Channel selection for our one of the sixty eight volume we should also be enough for easy
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium
point we already decided that on the previous meeting placed inside our project folder
chip on print think cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
lasting not not be anti it's a two minutes or thirty minutes of forty
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
sense that it you ask you give a question and three seconds later you say the answer
record into the device into the speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
agenda the base five presentation is once again or at least an agenda
