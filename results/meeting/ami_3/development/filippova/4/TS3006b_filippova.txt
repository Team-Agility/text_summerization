easier to integrate several functions in one button still and then just only a back button
design the basic function menu for the lcd screen
simple functions and these basic function if you are going to use the advanced options
button menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
screen is all the configuration options you can put that on the screen functions
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional requirements
reach a little bit for the power button but that's present channel
buttons to press the menu button and then you are certainly into the the display
feel of the left example and then the screen is on top which function
channel five on channel settings or channel programming your channels in the right order
design of the bus buttons but look how you can push them and like that so the physical aspect
indy it's the remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise
options we want to put an lcd options that's communicate with the infrared decoder
showed up put the the extra options all model to the on screen display
normal functions the basic functions you normally press
week or on the channel number in a remote and which want to save
integrate the screen or speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
channels and left or right for the volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons
match the operating behaviour of the users are not afraid of a lot of functions
annoying most small phones and also have a screen like on a mobile phone also on top
functions and on the Seems was it the target group so it's above forty
tv options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble on base
plug in the power cable when you go back it's only two extra buttons
department do we need just the functional display and for curses
features are hidden in the screen with the clear about the extra two buttons
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
signal of certain spatial frequencies it's a counters one it shows on your tv
irrelevant the less use for audio settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour
people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television with that usually three buttons and very hard
screen this you been option to go back to it to upper level the finally
kick-off working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
communication if the television it's difficult but that's not hard part you don't have to design
skip this price as because i read a ball forty is it from twenty to forty
save automatically in the project folder the teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information
