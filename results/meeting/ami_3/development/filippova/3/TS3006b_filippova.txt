easier to integrate several functions in one button and one navigation button
design the basic function menu for the lcd screen
simple functions and these basic function if you are going to use the advanced options
leave the menu button menu it or you can incorporate two different buttons
hand and the screen and that and it screen menu screen functions
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional requirements
reach a little bit for the power button but that's present channel
buttons to press the menu button and then you are certainly into the the display
screen is here then the logo should be like on top which function
channel five on channel settings or channel programming your channels in the right order
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
information came it was xx with all the steps in the remote control
larger public we have more options we want to put an lcd options
showed up put the the extra options all model to the on screen display
normal functions the basic functions you normally press
week or on the channel number in a remote and which want to save
integrate the screen or speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
power button and channel and volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons
marketing research stated that users are not afraid of a lot of functions
button on your mobile phones and also have a screen on top
functions and on the Seems was it the target group below forty
tv options which is all this the sound and then within sounds i trouble on base
confirm a want to go one step back it's only two extra buttons
department do we need just the functional display and for curses
features are hidden in the screen with the clear which buttons or active
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
match that the channel frequency or your tv and so your remote
settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour etcetera
elderly people don't understand it so so they need a simpler remote
screen this you been option to go back to it to upper level the finally
working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components
communication if the television it's difficult but that's not hard part you don't have to design
sixteen to forty is it from twenty to forty years of thirty
save automatically in the project folder the teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information
