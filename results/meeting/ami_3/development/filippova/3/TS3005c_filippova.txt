important thing people like to last year was that the remote control
remote control has no way or in the settings menu or just you just wanted to know the volume
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
reacting projecting the buttons on the lcd screen was a rather small
colours it was the slogan and the corporate colour than a shape

shapes it is something between the square shape of round corners what's square
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
