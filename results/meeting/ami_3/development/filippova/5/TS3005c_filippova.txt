important thing people like to last year was that the remote control should be look fancy
remote control has no way or in the settings menu or just you just wanted to know the volume
remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
reacting projecting the buttons on the lcd screen if you make screen for called as matter
pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours will be easier to do in colour
meets more the young people can see it because it is the unique
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly people
hand there and then you want touch the screen
button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons won't get that small when a cds green
rise to shine and rubber the total piece of rubber is still the rubber isn't fancy
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
big difference between young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
press the options that so then we have an example of And then you should get the other options
options is the settings of the remote enough to tv and that a thing called cults settings
young people they liked fruity colours like reading brown light out dark red yellow green blue
round shapes As soft with the materials like the rubber is the best suits poll up material
easy choose people something like that Like the ipod do something with the round squares simple
remembered and menu to go back good morning joe or which made this and this the easy
settings menu to look up some some channels on your television use is called a scroll
printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip
questions about the design and user interface there are going to work together on for a foundering a smartboard
shapes it is something between the square shape sit around got on the round corners what's square
lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
Channel selection for our one of the sixty eight volume we should also be enough for easy
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard materials like wood the titanium
switch it just from the previous meeting that they should we should use our own business colours
chip on print think cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
meeting is once again in thirty minutes or thirty minutes of forty minutes of use Nx
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
sense that it you ask you give a question and three seconds later you say the answer
slow you can make a versus the microphone for the speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
