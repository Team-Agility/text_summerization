press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
push buttons which is what real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
keeping a very small and simple set of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
depending them a week at a buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting
screen menu of your channel traces then you can scroll through like you can use your buttons to scroll
important features for a remote is seen a menu system a bit like on the ipod
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the television send information back to the remote control
buttons for your favourite channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
decided on like a simple a regular or advanced chip we can have a simple chip depending
ri uses for buttons to me to move around so range of settings so on a small lcd screen
time when you're watching tv if you're changing the brightness tuning the tv and the button to switch
idea of the kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display would have to be quite small
case out of plastic them the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons
ideas had it possibly use these and how to use a fruit and vegetable or or the spongy material
fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case it can have any titanium
sit there and stand control the television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end up with the device going to work
essential properties of the user interface we have to decide on whether i have a scroll
solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
minutes from the functional design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
number of different choices for a design concept and start something that or show you some examples
considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information on how should report are produced
hit my understanding of old latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
find a way to protect like the chip
mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre
