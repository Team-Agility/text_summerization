designing a new television remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control
energy or information to the chip that works with the user interface that isn't too complicated
imagine just it is an electronic device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
people are only using ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote
talk about the technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements that people satisfied
suggest that we could go about this is by designing the user interface is for this product
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people
lots of buttons and the relevant the polls buttons could be yellow but we can play
weapons you have like you have numbers but you before the next meeting in terms of users
frozen he can show me to pick up the remote all they want like an upgrade
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume changing the channel settings
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicated like program your television and the power
parts of the working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition was inverse be related to age
analyse people's desires and needs focusing on the designers people specifically said that it's not remotes were ugly seventy
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of an lcd screen was brought
crap remote taking with their tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
sends a message to the television screen just and some text things and they looking graphics
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find specific target group were saying fifteen to thirty
battery and that that the chip and convert that much data and presents a while without strips gathering
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver
economic we need to find out find a balance between features and price as you mentioned
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest frustration
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes i emailed them to you and also putting
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
coffee at the end you just only when really going on or even that those things can go out and you're happy
price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
