buttons are you don't necessarily need to have it on remote
links into the different depends on what type of buttons on and the shape was so some that's that are be pressing like a volume but instead of that one button
important aspect is the remote control test will have to look at how the remote today but it is the kinetic
remote control would be cheaper design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface
agenda for this so this particular meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design minutes to just black buttons
lighting in the buttons so one same colour it's face plates are busily to keep in mind
command interface requires you to type text role commands that the user uses to control its operation and input at the keyboard so the numbers
clip on plastic and put it in rubber plate going on top or would stay
aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user interface design an hour more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons
surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television that people will be movie remote
cutting edge technology wise kinetic energy source idea that's been used by some watches and that devices where you just shake in the device and it gives it to power to make a circuit
numbers of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power would be some symbol
actual remote would be hard plastic and the casing is that would be were rubber encapsulate in all of these Chips and diodes and delicate technology
Pop in tarot will have to work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job
stick graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point five elements on a scale of ten that's brightness
source that are that's quite an advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house cat our dog
lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat then i got like on a cell phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons that actually that control controls that are behind the rubber
closing so we have five minutes to finish our meeting
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty just the basic shape
lee back inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
main internal feature it is a circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source
weapon for the simple the weight that was the advanced chip that we going to meet so it's a medium or regular
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
source is not necessarily a battery be as most remotes use two batteries
recent fashion update to have a quite a fashion watchers in paris and milan is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style
popular thing we came up out of your market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
method was mainly web-based research this time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris
adjusting light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting the interior lighting system
shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real swimming or a store we see the relief of displayed
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint in a trying call
dynamo which is the thing that was used to which is fifty years here real remote
personal coach will be the best of the information We need to start making some more specific decisions
problem with international a appeal if we have audio
impact if it's got to something as they wouldn't damage just it's not so easy
