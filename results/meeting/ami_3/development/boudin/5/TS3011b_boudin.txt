dec design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons
easy to find remote control button remote control function of remote controls and let them buttons
round buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake
function and the problem to programme button or change the channel or to not the volume
important button And there are lots of people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote controls
buttons for the advanced other Functions decide it and our target audience
remotes are reports it we give back to the user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept
relevance scale the channel selection you have them to most important or volume selection and the teletext
home station for base station next a tv set would have such a button because they are lost the remote controls
buttons like that which are easy to use rc is the best one possibility
board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet is replacing teletext
consist of battery infrared diodes buttons you have that's the cheaper that the chip which just a voice recognition our circuit boards
device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find the one solution
multi function and can be implemented in in our design or energy save design we should really implement
restriction the characteristics of clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound from other sounds which aren't exactly the same from the point if you all from remote control
people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
elder people do not always want to use the voice recognition has the main it stand
total design of this piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions
requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people than less than forty years
disadvantages that there are so concerns about the costs and things like that battery lifetime energy saving another advantage
hope personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user
user interface connect to chip there are few buttons connected to the sender which generates
question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques and the user friendliness
decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume and the programme one and some fancy lights
user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control
regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons
list of functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all functions available device that size and all the buttons
work i have no time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
light for that when you move the stick to to a position maybe light
important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product on the target group and the functions of the remote control
older you might want to constrain that portion market will Examples will change adapt
interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components
ten minutes i make into the shared folder
cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem I opened the cd rom box
