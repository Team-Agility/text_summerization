important thing people like to last year was that the remote controls
remote control has no way or in the settings menu or just you just wanted to know the volume
wireless mice has to be remotes to the size
main you can fit the lcd screen just use and all sex or another as cleaning consulting
pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls
important position the people can see it because it is the unique
trend watching the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly people
hand there and then you want touch the screen
chip on print what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button when you get a lcd screen
spots but also possible to create fancy colours wood rubber that's or a that's used to make the case is the same colour
hand i did single covered the curved single curve
big difference between young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device
large a button or if you have several options appearing on the screen the colour nations
called cults settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu
young people they liked fruity colours like red white yellow
jeanette a soft rubber is the best suits poll up material
shapes like a week you said is that's easy choose people something like that Like the ipod do something with the round squares simple
morning or a coffee maker and it says that says do you back good morning joe or which made this and this the easy
settings menu to look up some some channels on your television use is called a scroll up next to the remote isn't that handy
printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
colour titanium or you have to pay chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip
user interface are also some questions about the design
square shape sit around got on the round shapes
soft but if you should the feelings spongy use of sponge bob like face
menu for button channel volume we should also be enough for easy
drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard materials like wood the titanium
point we already decided that on the previous meeting placed inside our project folder
chip on print think cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope
personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty minutes of use Nx
include rechargeable batteries not like to load
question and three seconds later you say the answer
record into the device into the speaker speech recognition if you want to implement
show some points on which we it should take a decision
elaborate something today i elaborate on the concept
today we once again have a three presentations at home
