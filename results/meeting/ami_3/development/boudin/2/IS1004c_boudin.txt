technology we need to the remote control
base decision and there is a button there are that are more to start beeping so with the remote control that looks like a banana which few buttons i have to be at some point it has to a circuit board
include rf structure in the remote control so i was all the idea that we can have to power source for the remote buying
remote control to be the shape of a banana Shaped object
remote is going to have what they interfaces scroll as as button but push technology for channel selection volume control and they need exposing these are the three scroll buttons on the banana
player the preference of the users out like this then they don't want to have one remote control a thing which a user interface
end of the banana if you could have the colour of a banana
findings is uses would be really interested in a look at the doing to find out what's it even if it wasn't a recharging station even if they didn't have to buy batteries that rechargeable batteries so all the period of car find a fancy look and feel down in the technology gonna be know in innovation
extent it be a text in the remote control what having an a base station for the telephone handset
powerful are powered by a man though it's a button on the fruit design the number eight maybe we wanna so what collection of fruit but a different fruit for kids
morning coffee machine me to recognise that for it and it'll play back good morning how would you like a coffee
rising is a factor for us that so we'll go for the regular chip in banana
honesty say that about to the use of the gd screen on the On the remote control because of costs
worth but it doesn't really add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech recognition technology just because of some reasons and all honesty
wall or a sporting keywords but everybody's and saying it's volume and channel we also want one for the volume is it's it's very handy for it to have the instant feedback and response
received an email i'll and lunchtime they know that the bring in mind to the technology division has developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit
unique problem with television's is that if you have this got this scroll-wheel for the television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll
mall like a point without worrying too much about how to develop
basis a extra for the functionality is such as the wheels the speaker you need so that in on the list but the device which can do all many things idea why a switch these days and to watch
find more interesting more important needs a fancy look-and-feel instead of a instead of the car and The car and train which was for the functional look and feel so old now More more core aspect not more hard core that aspect rather than a devise ways to many phones times on many buttons
card application i would presume that it's they wouldn't design as a fun
pushbuttons the traditional users so that they don't feel the and i needed list
combination just to train it's not the law and channel four hundred channels you have to be a tool to recognise
marketing people or nineteen ninety five percent of young people are worse
real recognise i he was but he was in a set not like a freight you train it for a certain for a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back the phrase in response
clarify this these questions that they had in the meeting we should take a decision on that point
break so you'd have to worry too much about the case the chip then if it's too far away from a the casing was the casing is too thick then you may not hear the the speaker
move on right so studies running with the prototype is but actually integrated
cells and the lighting conditions are good that can be useful it'd be pretty in a week
advanced technology lcd has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out so it's the basic
default be forced the findings a meeting i like to draw some sketch about so which would be the pro the final product and that were strip
shape if you'd and not be out the door probably you may as do it in a style as way that just looks a bit more twenty first century route and sixties and seventies
plastic you can have the book but the side not the materials like wood that's got a grinding you put some of an agenda
set it that's a switch with the double curve would actually menu
microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big deal
