ordinary square remote control and remote controls as good morning
basic buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons
current controllers are all black and plastic then the buttons
document be sent to the station of the remote control and the recharger
back lights look will look very new one know rubber buttons
numbers should be in the bottom and the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons
important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel instead of the current functional look-and-feel so it's very important
top buttons are wish there should be on top band
modern remote controls the buttons are part so focuses on these two parts
drop it you wanna change the volume on the side
man a young public you should use materials or soft with primary colours like green blue red so Flashy kinda colours the shape
buttons normal rubber like normal ordinary buttons soft
sense if you put it somewhere in the chances the beautiful scroll wheel
decided that we don't to make use of a lcd or speech recognition you need some way many more buttons
spec to the remote control should be easy to know me for a push to the yup
integrated in the chip so if we use speech recognition
fronts in red and yellow and it did the top and black and yellow the world
main points said You have to be original in technological innovative big door
chip can be a simple a regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced
original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod And and three players mobile phones
date display in the ipod a compared to the basic or you can choose
display requires an advanced chip if we use an lcd
divide you have to round it on the button and of skip
room no just battery context like normal batteries just a rechargeable batteries expense
country use different for fronts that's always know the logo
receive information about the cost but just a about the chip
usability is very important people that want to spend money on something that's similar devices and my own common knowledge
sense for an original look and feel of the case transparent on the wise the backlight one work together on a prototype drawing a smartboard
kinetic a like but the polls watch so it operates
tad next aspect also in contrast to last year the feel of material suspect it is expected to the role on this one at this moment
target group we talk about was young and trendy
developed a new speech recognition feature integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit is a very small electronic units will give a standard answer of should recognise the question
telephone also have a lcd and that's about two hundred euros
clothes shoes the ta
sports and gaming to vines style two or three sticks
