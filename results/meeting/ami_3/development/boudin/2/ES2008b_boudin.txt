sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control hear she expects the buttons to be in certain places
brings energy going to the user interfaces controlling the chip
imagine just it is an electronic device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message
time of tape ten people maybe people who have problems with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons that they have offered to them on the remote
mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled That extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design presentation and the functional requirements that people satisfied
industrial design if you're components concept user interface is for this product
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people
lots of buttons and the relevant the polls buttons hired
Space is similar to a very basic weapons you have like you have numbers and sports colours
Someone's looking to buy a new remote and that ties
audio setting is then given it much important and visibility on the remote as a minute channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the volume people
complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
parts of the working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
voice recognition was inverse be related to age so younger people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice activation
focusing on the designers people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people
investment should use novel idea of an lcd screen was brought
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices
control in this index opinions on the television dv or in it that are just a television that or focused
find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find specific target group
components that we find here are the energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
find a balance between features and price as you mentioned
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion in electronics
fifty percent of the people mention that was the biggest
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
instruction manual it comes at the end that's and hot because of the combination
price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range of ages
short amount of time you get specific in crap instructions from your personal coach emailed
lucy ready tidy right Let's see lucy
