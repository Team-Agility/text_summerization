links into the different depends on what type of buttons we have an input
annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote control
remote control would be cheaper design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface
plates in this meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design
wimp should see what the success of the first face plates are busily to keep in mind

slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop
inside the casing because wall you'll feel the material is expected to be spongy
circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at ed
separate apart from the chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons
brings it thing we need to be recharged and the bulk the size

tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style

diodes transistors resonators resistors and passes it could pass it is all need to be considered
Display anyway you that will probably won't have to focus so much not be more than the numbers
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint presentation
dynamo which is the thing that was used to which is fifty years ago the ousted
personal coach will be the best of the information We need to start making some more specific decisions
