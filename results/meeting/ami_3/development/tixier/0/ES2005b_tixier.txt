kinda feels a bit different from a lot of remote control
Seventy five percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons
sorta speech interface to it you only need to find
consumers they're willing to have pay more for speech recognition in terms of the interference and not working
add speech recognition as as the glow in the dark
remote control know what's been produced by the television
functions for tv but as you pointed out people
industrial designer my job is to take in input
user interface for this to be just a bunch of buttons
basics that was a basic function send messages to the television
bill since the tv and then also made it pick up the noise and turn
detailed market survey on consumers was bound to find
subtract a cancellation of the noise
told us that Consumers are willing to spend more for fancy product
speak recognition limit the number of button
major factor to load take into consideration when i was a profit
remote for to switch the channel
low tech and not too many buttons set appeal
noise over certain threshold on a topic up as a distress signal on from you and i'll be back
work with all these product i have a great deal of experience with the industrial designer
cheaper than tft it's just a microphone and some integrated circuits
material is Maybe not this a tail maybe more like this work for a materials
reports in the project documents folder
definite requirements that they will that we need to scroll
pretty in the house or say that in this a day in this part or age group from fifteen to thirty
bells and whistles we gotta come up with a gimmick but not too complicated
safety point of view also we have pretty clear
basic are frequency so i'll be cheap
integrating the rabbit integrate the logo
update but it anyway so your hand held portable
twenty five to thirty five is the usual
base station so essentially just a lead to have a self connecting break
organic shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corner
cut the classes once i hit
cost more like as opposed to with batteries
