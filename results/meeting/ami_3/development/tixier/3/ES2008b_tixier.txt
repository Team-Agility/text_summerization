sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
personally what i want from a remote control what we want to do it sends a message
appeals to younger people are only using ten percent of the buttons
source and talk a little bit about functional design of the remote control
designing several different at the types of user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
designed to like this you have your energy to granting the beans
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and that might be older people
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote
focus in and those volume and channel and changing the channel settings
button on the television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
combination of electrical work and then the other things that are brought in to make it work design
sense we're gonna have to aim for a design which is fairly conventional in design
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition but at the price
focusing on the designers people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
question earlier on whether this is going to be to for television
target group that means that is very few we need to each group
battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
bring the data is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
economic we need to find a way of striking a balance between features
finally it is more marketing our corporate image has to be recognisable
simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grind
price limit of the twelve and a half euro to produce
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
