technology we need to the remote control
buttons are in the shape of fruits these buttons i have to be at some point it has to a circuit board
states for the ease of handling and there's some other income for a remote control
remote control to be the shape of a banana if you want to point
functionality is just a couple scroll-wheels not button it's hard to get so many button
users out like this then they don't want to have one remote control
hold like the way you the end of the banana and plastic
findings is uses would be really interested in a look at the doing to find the remote
bite the things that by nine that and the base a station
concentrating on like a fruit or you want to some like fruit logo
design for a coffee machine you notice a hell are in the morning
regular chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana
cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production components
technology that we can add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech recognition the speech
suggested that we have some wheels to control the volume and channel
plastic with some elasticity so that if you're of the remote control what's the sample sensor sample speaker

designed to be square so they'd attack start it in the boxes
house and now you don't want the traditional users so that they don't feel
watch channel four hundred channels you have to be a tool to recognise
marketing People or nineteen ninety five percent of young people are worse
recognise it can be like a match on on a certain phrase
back to the minutes of the last meeting we should take a decision on that point
gap so you'd have to worry too much about the case the chip a lot is going to be sitting inside
city's would not be possible to implement it for the next prototype
cells and the lighting conditions are good that can be useful it'd be pretty in a week
completely to forget about the lcd has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out so it's the basic
default be forced the findings a meeting i like to draw some sketch
decided that we can and spend twenty first century route and sixties and seventies
thin veneer of wood that's got a grinding you put some of an agenda
double curve would actually menu and you could like drawer something on on the whiteboard
microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big
