process i'm thinking about that either part you could argue that the remote control
simple button and speech recognition technology we take at least five euros or that you put some control we want to reduce
device on that can be used for speech recognition and it's cheap or a remote control
people dollars for which the remote control is Is to be something useful that i'm going to talk
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons
back and not to look at a new remote controls it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole
Line that maybe you can colours around and depending on the temperature
market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and battery
chip do we have only the plastic or that cd five or A chip
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology
location and these people are really interesting on those features or they really like They're more want these fancy features
hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
concept of the interface we used and if there is some supplements
remote control we should be easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone
sixty then you make a lot of money are you don't and you're out of business
shape it has to be more wrong than the More roo look natural
end we find out that it's not feasible in terms of sponginess
interestingly this is the very most important thing it has to be fancy
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
story that for the point before why not the rubber is expensive
ready in the post and down to locate then we have to go for some speaker
propose but the use of solar cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy would solar cells hand
chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive compared to lcd
selling point maybe it has to be the base
record the the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes
friends you can travel from golf to furniture so it might be fruit and vegetable
tv has to be new with some of the newer technology inside
presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that Mark and then sandy
reduce the cost on the display would only be displayed and not a touch sensitive
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
trend i hope i'm going to try to help you want that this is more risky
component to use for energy and the media and the interface for energy
oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning
puts lots of concentrate
