press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
lots of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional button
skin on screen menu then we can scroll down on the scrolling
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu
bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel flipping and then the other white
intrigued by the idea of the scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
chip we can have a simple to shaking around will make it work
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen then back up at your tv and people
tend to watch tv in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display
main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours we could colour
curve of a case we could do a flat which flat case the curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
sit there and stand control the television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
member of that this is the device that is going to be useful to people
concept of the user interface and we'll come back to the chip
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
determine what the essential functions of the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features
minutes from the functional design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
list a topic of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
find a way to protect on the inside
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
fashion and simplicity and easy to use is necessarily the right drinking personally
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre
