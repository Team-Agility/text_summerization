hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
keeping a very small and simple set of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional button to switch off in case you get bored
skin on screen menu of your channel traces then you can scroll down on the scrolling
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
people to be able to use it as a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
buttons to select your favourite channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
regular or advanced chip we can have a simple to shaking around will make it work
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
tend to watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv and the button to changing
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time i am imagining
buttons could be shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours maybe free vegetable colours
curve of a case we could do a flat which flat case the curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
sit there and stand control the television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
member of that this is the device going to work together on a model using modelling clay
properties of the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface and we'll come back to the chip
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery is worse things get most exciting
pick a first could be spongy latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
fun doing it components design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
number of different choices for a design concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts
considerable notes on the topic of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
find a way to protect on the inside
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
plastic but we have all these fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre
