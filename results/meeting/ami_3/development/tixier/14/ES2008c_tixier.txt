press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
economics it's probably better to push buttons would recharge the battery
lots of buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features
depending them a week at a button to switch off in case you get bored
screen menu then we can scroll down on the scrolling
suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu
people to be able to use it as a remote control
scroll through the channels and the volume favourite channel flipping and then the other white
intrigued by the idea of the scroll wheel is then the pushbutton
chip we can have a simple to shaking around will make it work
advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen
tv and the button to changing the brightness on trying to see it happening
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic that you don't have to replace
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display
main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours we could colour
curve of a case we could do a flat which flat case the curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
sit there and stand control the television from your armchair
member of that this is the device going to work
properties of the user interface and we'll come back to the chip
sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
fun doing it components design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work
number of different choices for a design concept and start
list a topic of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
minute or if you the minutes left of the meeting
find a way to protect the circuit board
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes
fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard
easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor
packaging it's like the po so instead of opening armed bizarre
