sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control
chip through the use of the user interface that isn't too complicated
personally what i want from a remote control what we want to do it sends a message
appeal to people are only using ten percent of the buttons
source and talk a little bit about functional design of the remote control
designing several different at the types of user interface is critical
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy to granting the beans
lots of buttons could be yellow but we can play
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote
people are so is that like change the channel and changing the volume
button on the television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
parts of the work design they need to be figure
sense we're gonna have to aim for a design which is fairly conventional in design
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition
focusing on the designers people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television
target group that means that is very few we need to each group
battery and that that the chip and convert that much data
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
data is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
economic we need to find a way of striking a balance
marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying
simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
uh_huh fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
worry about four minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
instruction manual it comes at the end of the spectrum
price limit of the twelve and a half euro to produce
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
short amount of time you'll be able to access more of the website
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
