easier to integrate several functions in one button to confirm
design the basic function menu for the lcd screen
basic function if you are going to use the advanced one but a lot of options
menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu
concentrate more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen
watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional functionality
reach a little bit for the power button if you grab
press a button and then you are certainly into the the display
wary of space left and then put a logo should be like on top of sweet
harder to if you have already program it to swap
changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design
time to learn how to use a new remote controls
options we want to put an lcd option that's communicate with the infrared decoder
showed up put the the extra options in this case
normal function the basic functions you normally press
week or on the channel number do you want to save
speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone
navigate the channel and left or right for the volume
marketing research stated that users are not afraid of a lot of functions
microphone it can be very small if you look at your mobile
update for the audience or the target that's a group of forty
needed to integrate those sound an An image options which is all this the sound
confirm a want to go one step back it's only two extra buttons
functions your hand will block the display and for curses
features but we just have to build them in because they find
action so you scroll into it e you select a function like fall of like a base
threw it at transformer it's the signal gets a boost that and then sent to the tvs on the tv and that if you will Translated into a function
problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway and lots of the times there is a brand present
elderly people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television with that usually three buttons and very hard
screen this you been option to go back to it to upper level which twos and focus
lunch break and then we can work for thirty minutes
consequences on the marketing a part you don't have to design
sixteen to twenty five to thirty five to forty years of thirty
received an email so i'd like we'll use so i'd just drop it in the folder
spend a lot of time to integrate that information that i need so frustrating
