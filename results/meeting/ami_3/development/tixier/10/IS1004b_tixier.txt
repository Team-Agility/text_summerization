research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
brought new technologies for young people are what it about the shape of the remote control
keen on going to speech reckon rec system it might be a bit difficult
talk about price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
application and then shape of the button is important but also it the number of buttons
scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen just for changing channel
button it increases the difficulty of find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break
programme name instead of the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad
red so if you go to the market and you say that buttons that they're the people it is and on top
feed the targets in front of cost it's not possible to goals two lcd
television where you can say change the lighting in the room and that cords out of stand-by then for a device to the receiver
produce the tv you can have a lot of these background noise from a tv
pretty wide range of remote control shouldn't be very they have looked pretty hard
depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons
restrict the remote control to tv only because of time but on the On the chip
industrial designer should work was supposed to work on and so on the working
relation to know you would be cheap as compared to also use going to implement
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
work and user interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology switch at existing
focus more on the internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special

live in a little in each of the the main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
teletext but we want to get read one of four requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet
seoul extend past the hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should be similar to the traditional
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting there on the remote control
option since this is pressed to be kinda fashionable device is there's a certain factor that you can you can have with technology
master a very easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
opinion there My and all these mine though shouldn't be bit smaller
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
mount the for the naming we see fault for the look-and-feel later so let's go for this representation
