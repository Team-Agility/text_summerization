sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
personally what i want from a remote control what we want to do it sends a message
time of tape ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote
includes an emphasis on making the infrared very functional design of the remote control
designing several different at the types of user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and that might be older people
number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
importantly though eighty percent of that they would be willing to pick up the remote
people are so is that like change the channel and changing the volume people
button on the television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
easiest thing to do is gonna be work design they need to be figure
sense we're gonna have to aim for a design which is fairly conventional in design
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition but at the price
focusing on the designers people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of exactly what this product
button on the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television screen just and some text things and they looking graphics
deadline the target group that means that is very few we need to each group
battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d data is projected to the receiver
economic we need to find a way of striking a balance between features and price
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest
order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
instruction manual it comes at the end that's and hot because of the combination
price limit of the twelve and a half euro to produce
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
