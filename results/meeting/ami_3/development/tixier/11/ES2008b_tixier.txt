sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote control
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
personally what i want from a remote control what we want to do it sends a message
time of tape ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote
talk about the technical functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design of the remote control
designing several different at the types of user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source
control so it's one has got lots of buttons could be yellow but we can play
backwards up down channel number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
people are so is that like change channel and changing the volume changing the channel settings
button on the television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen
controlling most of the work design they need to be figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
sense we're gonna have to aim for a design which is fairly conventional in design it's gonna be crucial
older people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition was inverse be related to age
focusing on the designers people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people
fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea of an lcd screen was brought
ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv and record
device that allows us to do certain effects on the television screen just and some text things and they looking graphics
talk about our functions and our target group that means that is very few we need to each group
battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip move the data to the receiver
overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d data is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared
economic we need to find out find a way of striking a balance between features and price
analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
Sit simplicity in fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest frustration
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
instruction manual it comes at the end you just only when really going on or even that those things can go out and you're happy
price limit of the twelve and a half euro to produce
quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
tvc ready tidy right Let's see lucy
