technology we need to the remote control
buttons are in the shape of fruits these buttons i have to be at some point it has to a circuit board
tv at the fancy thing that's true you can bring to we can bring to the remote control
fits in the hand and you had a lot of so phase two The for the control to be the shape of a banana
functionality is just a couple scroll-wheels not button it's hard to get so many button on the banana
design and you have to work on the user should it should be already p define
end of the banana you wanna of holders may you may be one of the whole like a gun know and you don't have to point toward the fall
findings is uses would be really interested in a look at the doing to find the remote
bite the things that by nine that and the base a station for the telephone handset
concentrating on like a fruit or you want to some like fruit but a different fruit
conversation with the coffee machine that that with producing is you can say good morning how would you like a coffee
regular chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana
cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production components
technology that we can add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech recognition the speech
suggested that we have some wheels to control the volume is it's it's very handy for it to have the instant feedback and response
plastic with some elasticity so that if you're of the remote control what's the sample sensor sample speaker
scroll past television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations
Twenty five twelve point without worrying too much about how to develop
board so you can have things like are on a cylindrical device that may be difficult to can have to build
find more interesting more important needs a fancy look-and-feel instead of a instead of the car and The car and train which was for the functional look and feel
genetically engineered for it is designed to be square so they'd attack start it in the boxes
house and now you don't want the traditional users so that they don't feel the and i needed list
combination just to train it's not the law and channel four hundred channels you have to be a tool to recognise
importance from leicester more important is that People or nineteen ninety five percent of young people are worse
sense that you can recognise it can be like a match on on a certain phrase
back to the minutes of the last meeting we should take a decision on that point
gap so you'd have to worry too much about the case the chip a lot is going to be sitting inside
city's would not be possible to implement it for the next prototype is but actually integrated
cells and the lighting conditions are good that can be useful it'd be pretty in a week
completely to forget about the lcd has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out so it's the basic
ripple it's all the idea we've had we had doing these presentations just to draw some sketch
shape if you'd and not be out the door probably you may as do it in a style as way that just looks a bit more twenty first century route and sixties and seventies
thin veneer of wood be done in and all those things but plastic you can have the book but the side not the materials we cannot that the book
set it that's a switch with the double curve would actually menu and you could like drawer something on on the whiteboard
microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big
