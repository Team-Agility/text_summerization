flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons so one same colour it's face could have its own colour of button
live up to our purpose of having a very fashionable remote should that the remote control that a lot of interface consist of a quarter of buttons
clip on plastic and put it in rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates
plug designs on to this type of rubber coating which is on the casing is that would be were rubber encapsulate in all of these Chips and diodes and delicate technology
lots of different possibilities for the energy you don't need an x then also the battery supply all solar energy source idea that's been used by some watches and that devices where you just shake in the device and it gives it to power to make a circuit
graphical user interface requires you to type text role commands and input at the keyboard so the numbers
depending on what kinds of the design minutes to finish our meeting we talked about our favourite animals
main internal feature it is a circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power would be some symbol of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume
pointing device that doesn't incorporate some of the graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point five times an hour
remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television will have the option of like people room style movie style
slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop in tarot will have to work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job
including the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip that we going to called so it's a medium or regular
abstract design like look at the basic battery be as most remotes use two batteries
recent fashion update to have a quite a fashion watchers in paris and milan is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
pushing the light is coming from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words
casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty just the basic But the functions course and forms
advanced would have to go with a lcd c Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
half in the amount came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint i can't remember what it's got at the components of the circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at ed
lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat then i got like on a cell phone a mobile phone so called a flat
looked at the design report from previous years and then the students
