lcd in front of the remote control if that's a good idea of maybe is a little bit Too much for twelve and a half Abduction
talk about the components of a remote control could just have a properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material we have to choose
harder but also on the colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour look like it the plastic mold is in one colour and thus those cushion pets around it are in another colour set
material it was a good idea to use the plastic and the rubber of the buttons have to be rubber
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station at the bottom
thousand and four you can't put something on the market which is on the ground
sell and then tie a title for programme or at least at a quite large part of it and then you get a very large lcd display i don't want to in a three the house
rubber double curved piece is is it a three dimensional curve in the design for a greater resemblance but with new with new colours
symbols of fruits and vegetables And spongy colours I found this image which is it's symbolises the idea of fruit
puts an extra x and on the simplicity of our remotes to make these two most basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons like that and to control test
number so we have the power button skip the volume buttons but that goes to that they have to be large buttons as black and white that's on the old grey
remind like takes place of the of of specifics piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity thing is just the shape should be for today this is fruit just round it's always fun to have something take a plastic
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people were a little bit crazy in one maybe want a little younger design and the them because i do that it dark colours simple electronic all chip is available with the led transmission or a transmitter
fire i was thinking about the of the we still want the joystick idea
basic idea you got we're probably gonna have like to type of material like the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights we have to incorporate slides
energy source i've got a lot of possibilities And lcd was a possibility for the remote control
Drawl really nicely of the best we can put the logo and all that back began a resolution with it the goal is backs industry a day when you're gonna something's
time you would have teletext and the menu nowadays to access the screen settings
save a perhaps a some tiny buttons aren't user-friendly then we wouldn't can implement in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv guide only for the channel with that we were for information about the user requirements
gotta find a balance of the minutes are very hard to read somewhere that i've got some fate fees
