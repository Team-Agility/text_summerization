talk about the technical functions design of the remote control learn how to use a remote
suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different at the types of user who's controlling the chip through the use of the user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and the relevant the polls buttons with essentials
sense we're gonna have to aim for a design presentation working designers figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function
time of tape ten percent of the people maybe people who have problem with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons that they have offered to them on the remote
Space is similar to a very basic weapons you have like you have number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote

aiming for a technological advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion we put the fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
economic we need to find a way of striking a balance between features and price limit of the twelve and a half euro
worry about four minutes i emailed them to you and also putting on them in the shared folder
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
