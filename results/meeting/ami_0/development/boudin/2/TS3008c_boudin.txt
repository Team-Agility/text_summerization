watching tv gonna watch a remote control with a base
components of remote control the case the properties of material we have to choose
wear off on the five minutes left my know how many colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour look like it the plastic mold is in one colour and thus those cushion pets around it are in another colour set
idea to use the plastic and a soft rubber of the buttons the case you must use or rubber
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station at the bottom
remote controls are already on the market likes really like set
idea of an lcd display on that we do lots of information
rubber double curved case is is it a three dimensional curve in the design already resemble some piece of fruit
fruits and vegetables And spongy material I found this image
puts an extra x and on the simplicity of our remotes to make these two most basic functions maybe buttons like that and to control that's lcd
numbers to power button skip the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
resemble what i already said a specific piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity thing is just the shape should be for today this is fruit just round it's always fun to have something take a plastic
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people dark colours simple recognisable shapes
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease
basic idea you got we're probably gonna have like to type of materials like the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights we have to incorporate slides
email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility for the remote control
tv has to send information back to the costs again but we get a bill but pretty cheap design to see if they within our limits of twenty five euros
time you would have teletext and the menu most tvs
chip the chipset and the board it'll off the shelf also the speaker and wireless retriever are all available in our company
part of the minutes are very hard to read text
