lawn wanna spend more money on the remote control when you're watching tv or your hands a little bit sweaty
materials and components of remote control could just have a properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material like a hard plastic
wear off on the five minutes left my know how many colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour look like it the plastic mold is in one colour and thus those cushion pets around it are in another colour set
idea to use the plastic and a soft rubber of the buttons the case you must use or rubber
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station at the bottom
thousand and four you can't put something on the market which is on the ground
sell and then tie a title for programme or at least at a quite large part of it and then you get a very large lcd display on that we do lots of information
rubber double curved case is is it a three dimensional curve in the design already resemble some piece of fruit
fruits and vegetables And spongy material I found this image which is it's symbolises the idea of fruit
puts an extra x and on the simplicity of our remotes to make these two most basic functions maybe buttons like that and to control that's lcd
number so we have the power button skip the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
resemble what i already said a specific piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity thing is just the shape should be for today this is fruit just round it's always fun to have something take a plastic
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people dark colours simple recognisable shapes
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease
basic idea you got we're probably gonna have like to type of materials like the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights we have to incorporate slides
forgot the email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility to put a scroll button
tv has to send information back to the costs again but we get a bill but pretty cheap design to see if they within our limits of twenty five euros
time you would have teletext and the menu nowadays to access the screen settings
chip the chipset and the board it'll off the shelf also the speaker and wireless retriever are all available in our company
part of the minutes are very hard to read because there are two documents that one layer
