money to buy a new remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy into data
energy source your user interfaces controlling the chip through the use of the user interface is critical
real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
control so it's one has got lots of buttons and the relevant the polls buttons with essentials
functional design presentation working sanders figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
time of tape ten percent of the people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people who have problems with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons
Space is similar to a very basic weapons you have like you have numbers and sports colours
team make a schematic of the way that the energy source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people

find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find specific target group were saying fifteen to thirty
brings energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip transmitting information to the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
end user is gonna want from this product appeals the cross the whiteboard range of ages
straight-forward interface like he was saying simple city in ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology
finally it is more marketing our corporate image like it's yellow colour we've we put fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted
find a balance between features and price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce
meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides
short amount of time you'll be able to access to the report that was a minor
