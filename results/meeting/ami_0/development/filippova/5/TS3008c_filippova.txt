buttons on the in the remote control and you want to retrieve it and the base
materials and components of remote control the case the properties of material we have to choose
colours are you are many colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour look like it the plastic mold is in one colour
idea to use the plastic or rubber the buttons the case itself and the rubber of wood or titanium
implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station at the bottom
thousand and four you can't put something on the market really likes really like set
feel the whole idea of an lcd display i don't want to in a three the house
rubber double curved case is is it a three dimensional curve in the design and mine
fruits and vegetables And spongy material I found this image which is it's symbolises the idea of fruit
match with that or old basic functions maybe buttons like that and to control that's lcd
faded the skip buttons and it should and the volume buttons you don't need an lcd
resemble what i already said a specific piece of fruit but just like the round curves
idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people dark colours simple recognisable shapes

materials like the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights we have to incorporate slides

bring their logo and all that back began a resolution with it the goal is backs and colours
time you would have teletext and the menu nowadays to access the screen settings
implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv channel
