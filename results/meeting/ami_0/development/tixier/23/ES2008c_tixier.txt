hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons would recharge the battery
people to be able to use it as a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
aim is to include them in the menu of your channel surfing a scroll buttons to scroll
lots of buttons for the features of the ipod the things you would use all the case out of plastic them the main
scroll through the channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
tend to watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv and the button to changing
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
round remote instead of like a rubber button down one like in terms of holding it like that so if she to a fruit and vegetables have to haul
intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
concept of the user interface list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
find a way to protect like the chip but a scroll machine requires a regular chip
member of that this is the device going to work together on a model using modelling clay
fashion in our case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
kinda like in the idea of latex cases that it's hard to protect on the inside
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
sending it out's only fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
