process i'm thinking about that either part you could argue that the remote control
men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser
cc says if we want to have a small number of buttons
people dollars for which the remote control is Is to be something useful that i'm going to talk
propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week
Line that maybe you can colours around and depending on the temperature
chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive compared to lcd
sixty then you make a lot of money are you don't and you're out of business
remote control we should be easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone
battery and also we want to go for titanium design we should of rub
shape it has to be more wrong than the More roo look natural
end we find out that it's not feasible in terms of sponginess
source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
story that for the point maybe it has to be the base
propose but the use of solar cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle or four euros
friends you can travel from golf to furniture so it might be fruit and vegetable and spongy
reduce the cost on the display would only be displayed and not a touch sensitive
concept of the interface concept what interface we used and if there is some supplements
trend i hope i'm going to try to help you want that this is more risky
