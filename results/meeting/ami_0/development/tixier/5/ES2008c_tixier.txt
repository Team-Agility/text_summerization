hand and you press the buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press a button
assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons would recharge the battery
people to be able to use it as a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control
intrigued by the suggestions that make is to hold is to include them in the menu of your channel surfing a scroll wheel
lots of buttons for the features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
scroll through the channels and the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
tend to watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv and the button to changing
dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display on the device
buttons could be shaped like a vegetable or or the spongy colours maybe free vegetable colours
intrigued by the idea that these are the options of using the kinetic that you don't have to replace battery
switch i was in concept of the user interface and we'll come back to the chip
find a way to protect like the chip but a scroll machine requires a regular chip
essentially we need to choose how is this device that is going to be useful to people
fashion in our case that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
kinda like in the idea of latex cases that it's hard to protect on the inside
function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description
order we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
sending it out's only fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes left of the meeting
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine
moving on to market research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data
