research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote control
feed the targets in front of cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
top of the could be a speech recognition gets in the way more than that helps
study with for incorporation of new technologies for young people are what it about the shape of the remote control
brings us to the point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty
sitting in between the video input to the tv you can have a lot of these background noise from a tv
channel already what's on If you have a list of programmed an lcd screen you just scroll for that program name instead of the channel
cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important
limiting the number of button interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain
restrict the remote control to tv only because of time but on the On the chip
top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros
work it does work was supposed to work on and so on the working design is so user interface
find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel
existing so deeply the book would be which is the comfortable if you want to get this and on top rated the remote controls
teletext but we want to get read one of four requirements i'd give it a marketing report
red so if you go to the market for the spanish mind but as a marketing expert presentation
easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
live in a little in each of the the main functions which have a couple of the round device
starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
