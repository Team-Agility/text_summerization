so this is a in a know type non at the buttons one was in a few buttons
if you do need buttons you can flip the redness there
so the buttons would be like individual users or
we used to there's a tool that later that and then That big A button in the middle is the on and off one it's not in the traditional
shift button maybe start again
it had all the basic buttons that they needed as as the and new technology that people said they wanted
But i there's kinda shortage of buttons

believe that because whatever companies a lot of their products in the shape of fruits to give a range of products so they of shaped like
they of shaped like a way see look at this as think of is to operate a given radio different things some to do like the way
some to do like the way banana shape so my project somebody one pineapple shape some more a shape so you can
there's also like that it will be fashionable to have these products in be a as a fruit shape
because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at the like school so
Maybe trendy to some i'm just not small and the fruit so
quite good like They supporters fruit shape because that's where

this Do it gives did it into this product based on the user requirements whether it meets the user requirements or not this product and end times
what does it in terms of providing environment that's a product
so we will see whether this product miss all the user requirements or not I i were first
And the user requirement is essentially just to operate a tv so
Basic requirements part of the pro of the project
to take like a product should be as customers requirement as but let us technology and it should be wiring to save so
save so says our product we use all these requirements i would also prefer to be rate rank one is

this is entering the evaluation criteria
so project evaluation we have on the crap
hm Is the project evaluated that is mine
So now is the final evaluation line in additional do all of our product how we
so this is very important factor for evaluation notes of that marketing
So these are the three great a good idea but evaluation of our product has

and end times leds as but if a latest fashion trend somewhat means
that the technology me is the requirements of the customers or not
How how conforms to the current trends
as far as the other technology it's got the latest trends in speech technology
technology but it's missing the screen and you said

but also we gonna have the company name on the front which is a little black a line in the middle so it and
that marketing strategy of the company has we already
has we already discussed that our company is quite rare bird in the market not only in
A know a personal the marketing expert i don't believe that because whatever
that's in a if you going to buy tv maybe the company all have The you can choose from a company on have two or three trace it is but the different designs we'll come up with one
our product me steve to face or terms of the market And
it's the remote control conforms to the company strategy is that the question
kept the company strategy so i would go for a one as we know only get to it but we were limited by

if we happy with designers they points any money if we don't have t but if there's anything
Now comes the criteria meeting with seven point scale and having this
like she has given the have views on the basis of design was she was a very interface expert radio can
it maybe having good design it may be a meeting all the requirements of the customers like it technology wise price for it but there's one thing
designs like we have everyone banana design and the other one is what ends and

thing these are just to scroll once we still could be channel up and down and volume up and down when
to know not quite have the scroll wheel and functionally one
because of the pushbuttons and the scroll buttons

means hand because we already stated that people do graph of fashionable things nowadays so
there are in mind that the specifications are we had to frame vegetables are quite popular and that people like something that is good to look at it and not many buttons are i would give it's because
because that's where people know look at our fair share data
at our fair share data shows that people like everything else everything that is being advertised like those shows and everything is being able to it in the form of fruit and veggie they were all getting them some as it is or showing some association with that So
and the second thing know people don't want any complicated or bulky project and i will say is quite simple and quite handy so that is also

if you hold it you can walk hold it is it does actually
hold on to find a shift button

a constant to select any more rubber
but we could only eat any proper goes a week or they use these are just rubber
are just rubber to your we are using the scroll buttons like this is the new ideas

to buy wouldn't have to be curved an act and
And Double curve on both sides
curve in this one is single curve
single curved is it on both sides
Like just got a single curve on that all have and the double curved would be if it was that someone curve out which i'm at the wrong
I don't like that counts as a curve over that's just a shape

The curvature rest like there is case
but if the parts and then like a banana out all and you are limiting don't
will like so in this case giving only one or two traces we are leaving limiting all customers and by limiting them
and by limiting them the olympic i would say the same thing over profit also

was in a few buttons as possible mainly speak recognition
that and the best one is one or more like a ball that we that to add a day you
so you can speak into that like little ball to talk it's speak quite mission
my chair or get you're getting a risk that teamwork

more like a traditional remote control
have on the crap out here is fifty Project
It's a having another couple of days holiday pay maybe in order for all of a
not only in terms of providing quality products not only incorporating latest technology is but also in terms of writing in my mind turns
like keeping it keeping in mind all the safety issues so
i pay for the sake silence i want so you have one right exactly

The we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons and it's gonna cost is for doing point six euros
So in order to say even are two euros i was thinking That we could have a sense of the same shape but just have a flat and
Eleven or other euros sixty
and white board you brian we go

so let's talk about are bonuses and the races really isn't so
talk to you that no fire agreement on
But in electronics it's not always quite say you don't always have so many choices is with talk that's i

All loch ness banana
i'd be the new ideas like glow in the dark like that we discussed
we've got a job made out of a rubbery teletext new material that we've got i
are going to me as a quite standard word standard or whether it can
so but material da will tell you can work this is we're going to discuss all this Do

but if there's anything you think we've raised out and then i feel free to have it maybe
yellow orange and it powered one
but doesn't have that fancy use solar power and the vibrating energy mechanisms like in

what stories the powerpoint i I was that was a phone
A wall or forgotten familiar the minutes but i will
one space other than no one space and that's marked it on the other one
that that you get this and they represents the charging stand
simple that's the charging base prongs of the boss but we used to there's a
Right right it's too induce more television watching this poster
And main problem that we have one for sleep being the finance
if you click back and that bottom right so we're starting from when you see arrow keys is that we're
would be bigger so we might be more space for the slogan on the front Because
you start cleaning up the clay
