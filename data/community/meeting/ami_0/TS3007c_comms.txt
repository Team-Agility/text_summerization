and we must reach a decision on and the remote control concepts
I figured that's kind a high tech when we remote control that when you pick it up in as power that would be actually
but you don't move a remote control too much
there are some overall thoughts about new remote controls they
At first i stick with it The lot of functionality with the slogan take care of them control to new done anything
And the volume control and problem control maybe
the parental control should good function to to put in the remote i don't
If i got kids and choose between to remote controls one who would pay rent control and one without then i would buy the one with
you can control your video recorder which of you when you
you could save parental controls on it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page and then
i'm not because for that happen you will have to deceive a signal from the remote control so it would i have to be constant a constant segmenting
What i'm what may be better is to incorporate and the separate device that that you can programme with the remote control and that's
control and that's provides parental control and that's just
besides the remote controller will have a separate
that's true but with a same incident and same happens when all you have a remote control so
The only difference is the people buying the remote control now get at the feature of parental control most people wouldn't
and not on the front row control or
is some menu of function you choose parental control and maybe for files will enrich when you would put it on but
Like first id from you can buy it without and with parents remote control or are we going to put it in and then just
so you could actually easily build in up a little control but it would
it to you could easily that easily you could easily do that with the remote control which still have
control which still have the problem about the television itself
the parental control will be incorporated but it must mean not too complex and the games

and it at safety to remote when you drop it so
i refuse off on that the users remote so
it's so the middle like all remotes should be a little bit small so you can put it in Inside your hand and
to save my granddad would buy this remote you wouldn't want to bother with all the all would give us the things that you just make
no what are you stop and john from our remote taking the channel
As long as it's in the primary feature of the remote this so
i i figure if you had two different remotes you could look choose one with and deceiver in it so you could actually
o'clock and there's just some little o'clock in the remote
seen some of red remote twelve o'clock in it so
it so the remote doesn't transmits one is off the shelf clock
problem just have depends by some blue and that was not part of the remote
our company so i had you are also with the marketing campaign when they put on a new a remote just some it for export And
thing when you put on the remote you see that just like when you telephone you see a little animation i

button you pick it up when you press buttons and if
buttons that additional or a touchscreen or we discuss it's
in mind isn't manageable budget wife would have to go off to this into simple buttons
always display the primary buttons clearly visible
Them have some other options that are nuts programmable with one or sample button and
button and all the buttons could maybe displayed here if it's necessary And
so we are gonna be the pro gramm buttons one two three four et cetera
the buttons but if you're programming the colour of the tv do not display twenty other options that are possible is
what do you think about a back and forth not buttons and Like in the internet
and if you're using the button a lot of times the menu will still be displayed on screen you just don't
the buttons will be a touchscreen but the main not be too many buttons and in the
It's just like globe in the internet explorer

we have decided to do with the with the touch screen that has to be
but if we decide to go on the lcd screen we would use and we have to use and the advanced chip that and that
is it possible of is it necessary to make a touch screen square it is and
the touch screens are generally square but it's the case
but if you have a square lcd screen you put a case around it there has like bolts or that covers part of the lcd screen but
it from a place and and an lcd screen walls or
their butts the main concept is take one break that screen
many levels do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then corrine on boston and push lost twenty times the just the
screen you just don't have to play games in between but if you're really
how why see it is to put it on the The remote and then you have like we know slogan screen with parents children
if the if you have the lcd screen you can add a small logo or at the bottom and you can

and want to watch what the difference is our checked what to do we want and then how can we do a minute add to the target group i what i found
but you don't use that games when you're watching television
When your parents are watching some boring for where you can think of remote and do something else
levels and channel one to one when you get in to work to ten and want to go back a while you have a problem just morse
Or if you're watching is to use sports on on seventeen and your wife is watching some soap want to yes
don't want to go down watching use it eight o'clock and turn it on the weight twenty seconds for the one on screen and we memory a cold and all settings
No but most people find it much more important that there are children don't watch a sex or five buttons on the television and the way to ten or fifteen seconds or so they can finally watch it because of the
and if you push children you don't have to the end but you can only watch chosen channels or
for it because you you're in many times in magazines and in your domain you said in bed they believe that children are are influenced by the television and
but there are a lot of people below forty one of the children in young age and who want them to not watch a violent or
of and you're thinking about some channels they had cannot see butts what you have for all the standard channels and only four maybe off ten o'clock in the evening five and from the movies come and
come and maybe some dining will be needed instead of of channels because if you're
maybe you just have to restrict it to what program so the parents as you can watch channel seven nine and ten and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock and
you can just plain wrong television make it that problem
you in it because you can like build on the back for a button and a sample somebody would just want to watch tv channels

There are there like more they liked additional materials like wood and such more wouldn't count
where whereas the young and dynamic like a more soft materials Think
a soft and fluffy and colourful and
a soft material for a remote control
That's the material the younger people want
like sponge bob like as soft
like as soft material be an asthma
wood is not material which you bill the remote control of
i want them make it more as dynamic for you solve all their butts

or we discuss it's in the previous meeting so i figured i'd just leave it at the lcd
at that traditional versus lcd figures green we're all set on that and
version of an so i figure if we go for a lcd we should have to advance so that shouldn't be a problem
and then make them menu structure changeable so if you press
and you other hand A menu structure so we are
And down here that this could be one make lcd the menu structure
No that if you are changing menu structure here it
but my preference would to be put it on a menu structure and
just make it an option menu instance tall paul files
on a separate menu option
i was thinking about is just a menu structure when you don't use it a simple la police the

what i did a society viewed previously use items my two different an age groups below
i'd prefer double because it feels
our main audience so that's people below forty preferred following at first
Very basic colours like the owners explained
fresh colours of a green red strawberry red you get all banana yellow
are secondary audience up people above forty eight forty is an age they like the dark traditional colours
We have to aim not at the main audience and therefore use for us colours
Would you prefer did you can choose the colour of your remote control or
we're aiming to below forty years but there
and you can just as when you bite you can select personal preference spare the control on enter password

just i figured that's is seeing that you will always be was an l distance of tv and from the tv that comes at a whole bunch of life
changeable so if you press a system that if multiple
just morse more and tvs you just you press one zero and it goes to ten knots to one
want i if we incorporate the tentel control let's say we do whatever still a charger goes up to the tv and presents up
And and or we install another device children can still go to the tv pop open the thing and
but i don't think when you're watching tv at her in a loud noise from the tv some more screening a one and if the channels let's listen to it
also it's a good idea but so very difficult to incorporate so
but tvs are incapable sending
At least my tv is it is a compartment which you can press and they're

and that they like sports and gaming and then just the vitality and
at mi a second sheet of personal preferences we have to reconsider the speech function the recognition it's
like something you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies like speak speech recognition and but
now but you don't use games when you make a telephone call just the same
came with that counsel control the games in the voice recognition
what do you guys think of the games in the voice recognition a person is thing that
A mail to form is mean that's very popular to use force reckon recognition but i don't
i like for voice recognition is too much and then the Ach games in
so the games are in it the voice recognition
the voice recognition and not on the front

be an idea but just the welfare tomorrow
welfare tomorrow the plastic versus another you we can choose
another you we can choose what they're what's better plastic them or rubber i'd
as a plastic also has a cheap fear into it knowing plastic
plastic versus rubber i did a
isn't possible to make combination what rubber is isn't it all bend a bold anymore so you got a structural or
all was one of the opinion should not rubber or plastic i
rubber or plastic i prefer of you two

And if you consider the option of using the solar panel
did but about solar panels you have to have a light as
for alternate but use also the solar panels you could actually use you could
use you could use solar panels but you'd have to implement them into a the remote control in your a bit less space for the interface So

laptop and so i had a little less time to complete
time also this time there will be three presentations and
One thing you've got to keep in mind keep the remote clear have too much fancier the same time
but if you're really treating the clean two channels would have time where to use your other options
if it's worth at that time and effort we're going to spend on the p of
p of it's a symbol function and it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time into programming because you will
i'm not if it's actually we have a missing that much time and effort into it i what
that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources are they

the energy can you you reloaded or just batteries which a mistake change the user interface
and ui a i had the choice between a few different sources but
but the two basic source that i've found with the best possible way the battery of this take on comedy
on comedy that's when you move something then it gets energy
you could use normal light but do you wouldn't get the same amount of energy but you would from battery for
I i prefer a because it's the cost on that much high and it just a bit more high-tech and then a normal battery if
but what were like say it you could use a battery that you just keep on the recharging whenever it moves and for less
when the battery doesn't work i usually shake it to like
whether we whether what i had ideas from when we move concerning battery versus kinetic
fifty cents a battery and
so we have decided on the things that i from i was the energy to combination between battery and kinetic the case will be

are you saying we use and the basic a standard model
if we are going to use additional buttons we could go with a simple chip said but
chip that and that would bring necessary cultures with it So that's something
I usually chip so aren't more expensive than one dollar
set on that and then also the simple version of an so
that's a simple powerpoint mark-up i want them make
system properties and there is a wonderful
You may use like windows xp a simple walk around you just push so one or two or three and
it just has to be you one is delay for all to store it has to be just simple plain but
plain but if you want to install a person each other
so in that way you could make a cheap model and expensive model of
model of a make the simple more on the deluxe model have
Maybe it's handy to build and expert feel and simple feel
la police the system properties in pilots pops up whatever all you can programme

The the concepts on we where we we must reach a decision on are from our two source component
component concepts and the user interface concept the first
the user interface concept with that type in the the supplement so
I went to paris and milan for some trendwatching
Our research and development department and i went to paris and milan In paris
In paris and milan we other of different people differing in h and in income and the amount of money to spend what they like in design a an material now this
to come back to your question and and the people milan and paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard like
second building games like snake what that research team use the younger users also
Or you could actually build in a function and you can programme it yourself for the more advanced users
ide du the industrial
the industrial and development the sense that if the user interface will work together on a prototype and

an id and i when i finish it off i have some in from a mosque last i i face that's If you if you
but when the power goes slow have to shake it
and as you wouldn't i have the full amount of power actually used to
it shouldn't we should have a power when you hold it you hand that so now that
We might even bounce back where you draw from top
you take your eye packing go up play gave
looked it's you've got a holder in one hand it's so
the another things and they were there was a serve v and it came out that people like to buy things from a single a large provider instead of those two are part mean with a so we must
so we must we must bring it as it is real reaction is it's a big company trustful company and
are three real reaction remote with
I i and another id to put ideal the audio for real reaction and a single brunt and and that thing when you
but No idea from this guy thing is that we must use evidence as we are a single large provider with an alarm
The mosque lots of friends than
But keep an eye on your laptop for a real

Hey a project manager
And project manager i have something to tell you i have a little problems
If that's the project managers problem a lot
you think about removable covers as mobile telephones telephone market customise your own remote control like the nokia
like the nokia the removal covers just put a read on it and go through shop i'm i agree one
it fits within the current market trends and
like See now regular mobile phones
also the link with mobile phones
for us first thing is we talked about nazi management knowledge engineering
management knowledge engineering and the fact that the idea of knowledge for sharing your knowledge from other companies know like that it's a
so it's mostly for the management expert to look what our marketing
and the marketing expert will you will be keeping busy with the project evaluation but the most specific
but the most specific instructions will be sent to you by email
i forgot are not set out to be manager

Welcome to the conceptual design meeting
notes and at the end of the minutes and we'll be at the shared folder
multiple system options can maybe five or ten or one can fit in or
because you will have to start working with profile some such and i'm not if it's
just make a remote as it is butts make an option to insert profiles to save
when you take in a number it will start in and recording but
but maybe there's some option that that the show few numbers are violence and that's their block that
this phones used for disease that someone will have sent all those show view numbers of the programs that data to be notes i had to tell we'll have to decide
If we do would we must do it in a way you said like a profile crime profile family profile and otherwise
you can show some money logo four point five seconds still remember it or that they're willing
she never know and next meeting starts in thirty minutes so he used
What will be a few the master glass lot of data work

you we could go for the single curved or double curved a single curve
a single curve it's just it's just a curved or
or what but you could go in there and double curved and that's like several different by mentions that gives
So i bet a big company and i agree are by one like or some us a big disk on them too so
that's should and shouldn't be a that big a nation a larger
a nation a larger that i'd put a big some areas we could discuss it a bit whether
and then we have single curve versus double curved on that
the casing around if you use and did a touchscreen is just the casing know around it so and
Like a big hit the flashy colours fresh it's
I we can discuss a little about the three counterrevolutionary things thing that came with that counsel
i have to console my legal advice
the case will be double curve and a rubber in for flashy fruity colours and with coverage removable the buttons
And with the with the motto we put fashion in electronics and
