and i say it's on this the document be sent to the station of the remote control more it has been done
it must be some very different from ordinary remote controls
television not that do not exist in current remote controls and that's very
that's a good idea because you if you and you drop your remote control very often on the ground so it has to be
is it a bit like the boards of a remote control
because of sense that is the most important thing or four remote control the control about changeable
just another shape than a normal remote control has just
to do it because it's only twelve jurors you have to spend have your remote control
what's the old remote controls amusement remotes more controls
this is one of the modern remote controls of a moment we
then bit smaller remote control you can cd or you have to but you reach both both sides new just have
in new new modern remote controls the buttons are part of the just it's part of the remote control itself It is
it is in add a good remote control
Basic remote control from our plastic and
but can you change it if you already bought of the remote control you
But normally you would remote control on the table or on the couch
can't imagine that solves remote control
assign every remote control so different
really new one because we still to the ordinary square remote control what
the current controllers are all black and plastic have to look at
So it you can put the bottom of the remote control in a recharger so they got
But we have to make contacts on the remote control and the recharger as
he here if you look at the wave remote controls are now
So it works like a good morning remote control and remote controls
and remote controls as good morning

just a did all the buttons like text easy to put that on the button
Because you can hold it you can't all the control and push the buttons
it's pretty standard these rubber buttons on the top
the buttons normal rubber like normal ordinary buttons soft
so that should be hard plastic then the buttons
but with three d a curved remote controls we must use rubber buttons so
And just with together with the back lights look will look very new one know rubber buttons
just to get a bit back that you'll get the button you knew a lot more like the that meant that and they three player

Light switches on if you use a button at
anything to have volume channel to choose channels and on off used to the button and that takes a few buttons other functions that
But will you will use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons like one two three
Like zapping is just switching one channel of the time
the numbers should be in the bottom and the switch channel in the middle
It doesn't make a difference if you put this this switch channels on side of it on top of each other because
Or you could do the switch channel up button above the numbers and switch channel down button below
but the top button is like you switch channel up and
you switch channel up and down button is that if you put them

to use because the volume and channel it's on the bottom of it so you can't
By just putting the volume on the side and
on top and buttons we don't use some in the bottom
No the top buttons are wish there should be on top but we
Maybe deciding yellow and it did the top and black
so that you if you like drop it you wanna change the volume only if you use your finger
But but are left or right is more often associating with volume and top down is more with the channel changing
a volume on the side so you can't make it you can make a mistake that's
so that's already a very big change compared to

good we can use multiple scroll wheel so if we want to but
And we need to plastic case is a scroll wheel
Like a very big scroll wheel
what i see the only difference is that we use a scroll wheel on the outside
And you have the scroll button and side or four
i maybe make the right what's it called scroll-wheel make it in yellow just like the colours of real reaction
but if you change from from the scroll wheel will still the plo
Think the scroll wheel want be very back sense if you put
sense if you put it somewhere in the chances the beautiful scroll onto that so it
Small scroll wheel so it's wants

so we can start a mass production and then
and then or that the buttons and that's basic buttons
basic buttons on off nudes and maybe two others i text buttons
So and then way so the date display in the ipod a compared to the basic
a compared to the basic buttons one two three four and for about ten And
by the product you by your get one and more basic or you can choose
or you can choose one if you buy the project

No the third one is the spec to the remote control should be easy to use but that's
cheap and it's easy to implement
maybe it's not easy if it's below it's harder to zap
zapping is the highest priority and then use those
Because then it's easy to know me for a push to the yup
very easy we already have the beeping of the so it's easy

The second the most important aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative
features and then that this is a point of discussion because
aspect and we must use some of the new technology to be innovative
main point is still is that i've no not a technological innovative how do we do that
top band that if we gonna put in more technology eugene need to be able to switch to open
did you might the main points said You have to be original in technological innovative big door

that part so focuses on these two parts
If you a man a young public you should use materials or soft with primary colours like green blue red so Flashy kinda colours the shape should
we have to put our real reaction logo as on the remote controls so the colours also
i don't think the colours black and yellow the world
The normal infrared led it's sufficient and
and in green colour the backlight or
No they're multiple colour leds so
this make it some different colours blue red and green
have to look at that image of ti part
a wide or just whatever colour but the same like colours

because we just decided that we don't to make use of a lcd or speech recognition The
if we implement speech recognition it would be better to implement lcd as
but a telephone also have a lcd and that's about two hundred euros so
If you want to put in this be great recognition We i don't think we should put it on top band that
So if you put in speech recognition you need some way many more buttons which you want
you see we just skip the focal or was the speech recognition
and i didn't receive any information on speech recognition so
that's integrated in the chip so if we use speech
chip so if we use speech recognition and that's in it

we should go more to the ipod And and three players mobile phones more than
just like a mobile phone you can make if he finds on it so you can just
but you could make them light blue and transparent so
I have a more my i have a blinking light on my phone and change the colour
but the ipod and etcetera but it or a small of phones
original and i hope we can make it look not like the ipod the cell that must have
But it is it is already fancy because of the lights on the bottom that's what difference i maybe

And it says and the chip can be a simple a regular or advanced and
They say display requires an advanced chip and
the display requires an advanced chip
that's t most expensive chip We need if we doing if we're doing a display
This is normal circuit board like chip boards in a lot of things which so we do
so we need the expensive most expensive chip if we use an lcd
then we use mean i must use the second most expensive chip so the regular chip because
regular one you have to simple one regular and advanced so as
i have some information about the cost but just a about the chip

a maybe a see-through one in a fruit front because
and some basic care colour fronts
We make you maybe you can put it yellow on the side and black on the front
The country use different for fronts that's always know the logo on it Do we do that so
Like fronts in red and yellow and blue one
to de curved is like front to the back and three d curves
we have if we do it like that we have the low if we will a lot of room to put in as logo
And how many falls the front so we put on the market and then five

the battery context like normal batteries can you can put in
Really a recharging base station
it just batteries rechargeable batteries
batteries just a rechargeable batteries expense
for a d energy source we can use batteries or
room no just battery that's cheaper

usability is very important people that want
people that want to spend money on something that's similar to a cheaper ones
that they find that the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel instead of the current functional look-and-feel so it's very important
I looked at some similar devices and my own common knowledge
people you still have older people it's only annoying
There's just one overall important aspect is that you must make it fancy and it looks original and

I receive an email with a few possibilities on the materials so i'll
maybe an extraordinary shaped like a sponge or
good it's mother into like this area up so the focus gets
the shape should be curved So round shapes not nothing square like
but nnn is a as round corners so
But maybe you can make it a round of a soft material just only
divide you have to round it on the button and of skip
A strange that i receive Information about that

So we're going to talk about the conceptual mono
so just show you the And i the the menu to that what's it called
our target group we talk about was young and trendy
a design so i did some searching on the internet
so my personal thing is that we should go more modern look and d player And
And sports and gaming to vines style two or three sticks
and because we definitely want to make it flashy to attract the young public
it could be like a nokia like from the just plastic it's that our problem
but we're aiming at a young public

There's a sense for an original look and feel of the case and interface
may be that it's about the clothes shoes the ta
But we have to make the case transparent on the wise the
on the wise the backlight one work so if you put
cases flats so uncurved
User interface concept
id and uid work together on a prototype drawing a smartboard
used and then you let it slide in the docking station

and it says fashion watchers off up a very i have friends and it's i have to take that following trends
the tad next aspect also in contrast to last year the feel of material suspect it is expected to be spongy that
that spongy but what does spongy says spongy
let's first watch balls presentation first them
or a kinetic a like but the polls watch so it operates on your
the trend is a spongy and fruit or fresh and
i'm not but we dunno if expected to the role on this one at this moment but

that stands for a new technical features
i'd i in something about this ergonomic fits in hand so
i'd of isn't has developed a new speech recognition feature integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit is a very small electronic
is a very small electronic units will give
units will give a standard answer of should recognise the question
Doesn't say use you say record followed by a question sample and offer a few seconds else or a sample
