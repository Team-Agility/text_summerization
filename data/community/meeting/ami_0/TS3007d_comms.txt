what the old version but this is a like a remote control for children
the remote controls beautiful
the remote control looks fancy
for the remote control was a big clear channel switching buttons
The remote controls easy to be found
if you put your normal remote control on their bad all you'd throw this remote control nearby is a better findable
my remote controls black
according to the other remote controls there may the be there in your tv room this one will stand out
if you're a fifteen remotes and drawer you find it
mostly when you lose your remote control is only a
The remote controls made of soft material
We also have to compare it to the To remote controls on the market now there so
eleven remote controls and all that this
The remote control was a remote with the removable call from north looks
The remote control it is speech recognition is false
The remote control and building games
if you promote kind then like like dynamic remote control that would sell button and a normal remote control
now you can shake your remote control
there you can go and do you never done a mike a remote control is kind that it
is kind that it stand out alt battery control remote
makes a remote control lot of type a team
About three functions where which are most used and which most it needs to be visible on a remote control it

concepts how to hold it with the buttons and and
screen this would be the main buttons you could
buttons you could change the matter on the non profile as you want to but
except for the buttons as it could be a standard model
at teletext buttons and volume buttons
No teletext buttons teletext is in the menu
it but you could make a teletext button six or was people
or was people read this i don't think we have no teletext button
but the teletext button you could that's in the menu so it's
Just just with ten buttons that's easiest
It is it is rather easy to use because you have the primary buttons always visible
are we tried it was buttons it's almost impossible that we are running so in your
You that you have to put switch channels at the top because that's the most used function and teletext at the second
the decision to make and the buttons on the top and the menu on the

And then for colours we figured starting of basic colours like why it's all the data grey or some
we had decided to put some flashy fruity colours in it
so it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as a standard and
colourful we would start a wide and a couple of it for fruity colours and
but we may the standard must be some attractive flashy colours not too but
it has is all these fruity colours and as a strange shape it
the remote control was fresh fruity colours
used to we've decided not to make to fresh colours is no it's not
Actual a special colour
i've reviewed all those feel a type one special colour

after that but idea is for just a imbalance with these two ja with these two so
idea we just want to build a more to the and all that one and old version of this
maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover so that you can take a cover in the shop
But maybe make it too because the games are in the submenu and not it's not an umpire again
You make a make an end specialised extreme cold version
The idea is great that's that doesn't work problem
New ideas about the working of the software for about the project about the remote control so
But the new ideas found for we would working with this software
may maybe the idea you propose to use a screen here and draw
but then the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it that is not bad idea actually Not

first house as we decided to use a single touch screen so we've
and as we should just have the basic remote with the panel lcd screen
so and so you can just be the layer of the touch screen and some of some wires on the need to make it as a thing as possible and no one could quit
the idea of the touch screen is
and now you have to keep calls in the in mind through drawing on the screen and
just like you said with the screen which you can ride also a floating mechanism
like that or a snake it's end of the parents control touch screen
touch screen so it's just a summary
touch screen you've mentioned

and i have to work so we're closing once again forty
During the design life cycle we
the remote controls design for people with h below forty
that's not just designed for people on the data for is also designed for people above forty
just other question is and that is it's designed for people with age below forty but
below forty but it's also designed for people right above forty so
it'll be primarily appealing to minus forty bucks also feeling
your room and i we the more design we could have more we have more room for creativity then you can
a pity if you if you have five thirty forty minutes for this things and we are now
but before we don't celebrate i have a little question which you can't answer because

But the overlying layer is a little bit curved
no but is it's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then And then no
i there so we can make it single curved or uncurved
or you can go from the double curved a single curved
this is just one person and not the back curved right
single curve but there's a curve in it so
if you make it double curved it cost one euro more but
And if you make the single curve have just a big curve
It is possible what you can to use double curved for titanium that's one
a year it is still the double curved the rubber the flashy you fruity the removable

What's the time we also have to do the evaluation the production costs and
we have not to to calculate the production costs if it's under
not can i say something as project manager The kinetic
but it doesn't fit in a car cost for also
Now it's about time to talk about this project
has an easy to use especially you and the know you both at the less committed for our roles in the project
we work together on the project but everybody has its own task so that's all this
we've it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things and that's the
more see the case from here we are with the management you get two minutes to make a case know if you have
two more the costs are within the budget the project
budget the project is evaluated but
Management expert you have to change
maybe you can add later that we decide it's in the end because the cost

so young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and purple butts when
butts when they're all are people ago when is shop wanna see an orange remote control it would be less appealing the white one and young people we think
and young people we think are a little bit more flexible our
flexible our by for a couple of your worst sunlight it but
but you'd you mustn't forget that we are targeting this younger people we had decided
and in the surf we from milan and paris it's it came out that the older people are more willing to to spend money on extra futures so
and for the people who are really want more sophisticated more traditional look they're willing to pay that's they want
too much this is a banana mango not purple orange and yellow
process and it just takes too many time people still
people still feel the need to write it's quickly on a page channels downloaded to say easier
or at least when you You don't have to adapt to technologies as you can whites
But if you're a normal flip over your a lot of people white text is not text option
it must be simple to use very clear what to do and at the younger people so this is really about
like what we don't have to buy parental control our people

Of you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your problem
we now the problem we have reached eleven euro
And that would solve budget problem
no advanced produce a little bit of problem
But end of the problem is you can discuss anything

during the meeting actions you concept of placing about some top usable with that and and the
and you can buy so we can make extra money
was a room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings
the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting
better and the last two meetings also we you wear it's some good decisions about the four
report i'm busy with and reporter and i know you might thinking what
about all the meetings what we have decided a report
your is a standing we can celebrate now but the report if
Yes not ten minutes left to finish at the end report
five minutes from to finish meeting
I'm going to finish my aunt report
and you buy this meeting is finished
you buy the meetings finish

So we began working on a concept
as you want to but the standard they will be delivered with this set up
set up with the mail more advanced menu sitting right here but submenus
that's a marketing angle on television we have two
but it to the kinetic would be a marketing promotion if you
what about all on the n forum and freaks of freaks
But that's mainly because of the information that was delivered to us it was just fixed
it's a tool i was a i was also very unhappy a very unsatisfied about
Digital pen i'd follow the first time i did the individual work i use it but out and
as a set of them are few moments ago i would like myself to buy the normal pen because most
it's almost same concept but you can just sit more simply put a dollar scanner use
use the same concept was the pen where you from to download softer was a very all
and should try to run once in a in a normal size or smaller
A picture from scanner clipart
You better use powerpoint certain work it out of the files and

first we have a prototype presentation by gng
was good use the word to gng for the prototype presentation
Opening a word document now
Has gone through and Say nasty words but i don't this strange
i was more like presentation is some points were discussed that
And it's still your own and writing a open up an a word
We real reaction the open now
If the orders in there if it's an important that's a word for
Real real reaction

it and then we must see it we a stay under the twelve and a half euro so
it's got stuck under twelve and a half euro then we can their move on to the project evaluation as we have the experience that or otherwise
of components we have to one two and do it in and see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro so
Explanation twelve fifty
So if we did this we are on twelve and a half euro and we're done
you make like eleven an hour of euros profit Instead of twelve now but
twelve now but I if twelve miles this fixed the fixed price

i see if you see a strange shape line somewhere and then you would recognise it as or that the stains that
think should be functionality and a fancy outlook so
a small will force nowadays
line of some little bit too small like a big trick or no
after class for the smart board
for the smart board so that's the main issue
large it was a race this line
it's a big big eraser
is the decision decisions system like
just a little group decision application
Was an issue look at the initial plan
One small thing and and it's functions wasn't included in the costs i don't think
but that decisions are put in the conclusion why we decided

criteria it in combination with findings i i received and an excel file
as it is a dn two or weird bumps in this is for the
this is for the edit effect of use and dynamic and the
the bumps then you can see it as a very it's a useful dynamic exterior
it to you just want to hold it if you were you a young and the dynamic like us
would be best to appeal to drop public and make the covers exchangeable so young
so i must be some cheap standard cover
were there room for was a room for creativity
or much to my type of features lot of your process and
and maybe some functions for a circle or square you have to
just type text that would be a excellent mean
you have ten minutes left red
fake it's like file like sports and then the cp files

battery and maybe even on or an electronic chips so and so you can
but we can do it glow in the dark so is it to the dark
so is it to the dark lady still blowing
Now on funds chip sample sensor
sample sensor sample speaker
we just put a good battery in a small will force
here what you think about a button a battery in it but also selling like the covers a docking station just part from the
But you can use rechargeable batteries in wages use your three weeks that's the menu
the the energy which turn out to be battery so
So i knew a commercial logo

evaluation treats criteria
after that in evaluation off the process how we how we have done it you with the smartboard there what are laptops with the All all this and i
We made a lot of requirements and trend the number so some
mouse of time to evaluate our prototype concept to To the past requirements So
So we're going to evaluate a design according to the parts user requirements and trends analysis
i'm user interface the experts
but the survey on the users was that they a really lost it
we have to fill in the numbers of the compliments of components we
consensus and everybody what was a green ring
maybe a little application like Give you a number and click one two three four five six seven
but that click it in an application that's a lot easier to process

we may that top or front view just
front view just like you wanna back to you as it is it
there is panel it we you would hide with some more rubber layers like we discussed
you which you wouldn't see the states panel but more fluently and announce
maybe we could develop a call for with would start Then
so we have to break the back flat same as
because if you want to go to kinetic your your a certain a half and you must go to flat and i
no but it's development inside corporation like
What's that what's the company call i'd just keep forgetting
why we decided to use a flat the lcd

and be began with a form of shape the this easy to hold win one hand left or right handed so we made
and and the menu structure if necessary other hand it's
lay down and want our all round of but it will lie
but it will lie a more in your hand like an old telephone maybe or
where the this and can be held with your hands wood is maximum
Is it is this lying on your couch or you thing was that for orange so
the lay around that fits the rounds be balls on the the brackets
