and all honesty say that about to the use of the gd screen on the On the remote control because of costs so maybe
so what are the remote control in the shape of a banana just
But what's the solution whole we can have some cheap like that on the remote
But that you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit or
To buy and need a corner remote control
is not just buying an eel control the remote you do need my income for a remote buying
you could build you could link the recognition on a certain phrase to some function on the remote control but
you if you said that the tv at the fancy thing that's true you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that we not have any
and as and you live in conversation with your remote control
suppose it so he's this is much more than be taking this technology we need to the remote control in using it's all this is
so if you see if it is something that you can we can bring easily it to put it into the banana remote control
at this time more couple of some of the features of that potential funky looking remote control
were talking about being able to find of the remote control and also
and also to that extent it be a text in the remote control what having an a base station control of things as it might
base station even if it's just you press that button on that and and the remote control starts beeping this is a way of finding the remote
so first thing is we need power source for the remote control so
the remote control so i was all the idea that we can have to power supply is one is that you should
Then now we need plastic with some elasticity so that if you're of the remote control what's the sample can directly into pieces they should be some
That's the states for the ease of handling and there's some other issues like we need the book then controls
it's very i'm gonna need it fits in the hand and you had a lot of so phase two The for the controls I get
than that user wants to help control more than one device want to control more than one device from the same remote control still
v because users out like this then they don't want to have one remote control for everything so will
So i understand really why they just two days speak lost control
Although you do need to include rf structure in the remote
will be so the findings is uses would be really interested in a look at the doing to find them as with remotes so that was really bad but

Means buttons are in the shape of fruits these buttons
these buttons are in the fit of shape of fruits upload banana have something like that
you have to norway with with buttons i have to be at some point it has to a circuit board so you
you lost it things to the remote control that looks like a banana which few buttons with only a few buttons
a button but going to know every design should have at a button and
functionality is just a couple scroll-wheels not button it's hard to get so many buttons on the banana and it's still
list and scroll button
these are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us and the company and we can
So you're having the base decision and there is a button if you press
is a button if you press the button there are that are more to start beeping so with the remote it's
and the old to bowl a job or button
That was the remote is going to have what they interfaces scroll as as button it's not going to

and you would not have they enough of the face to put their cd on the banana
not completely pointless For the in the fall from the interaction on that but do you
we could even consider that made we want to sell this is a very if it's gonna be a banana as a pretty gimmicky Think that doesn't have that much functionality is
switch way you could that you could turn out from attacking the top of the banana but it's
so it looks like going completely to forget about the lcd
But then i like a banana you can you hold it like this and have the scroll wheel on top and it's
i how you wanna hold a cap sit down and
i'm just wondering actually i this all fruit thing with the banana it's it's saying like if that seems a bit like an e a few people would really wanna banana but what if it
or not rather than having it a yellow one really looking zachary like a banana could make it so
And to give you can have the idea of a banana but without looking completely Teach the better one of the little
If i have to make something that looks like a banana if you could have the colour of a banana
and that were strip a mango banana and the the the we the basis
so i you wanna hold like the way you the end of the banana
the end of the banana you wanna of holders may you may be one of the whole like a gun know and you don't have to point toward the fall
the starting is good but you could you should have more the shape of banana if you want to point really think if you don't want
so i we need something that can fit a banana Shaped object

What what do you mean by fruit and vegetable and spongy what you mean close
I i them is and i saw that the fruit it's the if pictures of freedom is it or seen a little it
fruit bat that in that aspect of a of the remote control Many many colours remind some visitor was some
of a fruit or you want to some like fruit logo on
Not not in not that much follows not too much folk or not and not that's not the similar to a fruit because nancy that the team that would be different so
like maybe just like a little bit and a little fruit peaches somewhere in the corner but i about
you see all those i was unaware at this point of the fruit for kids
Depends if we if we are concentrating on like a fruit design the number eight maybe we wanna so what collection of fruit but a different fruit for each device out that
that'll be fine and the beginning but after one month you read that it off the surrounded of fruits
A powerful are powered by a man though it's a button on the fruit

this to get d player the preference of the users
inside but inside you could have you can still have some cushioning that's not visible to the user
Then we the old one in control a thing which a user should it should be already p define it should
lcd has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out so it's the basic thing
so it's the basic thing but really trendy and very user friendly
i if you use the user's gonna buy a banana remote
design and you have to work on the user interface you do you have

which is a way if you'd have a conversation with the coffee machine and all remote control
but actually integrated that into the coffee machine that that with producing is you can say good morning
you can say good morning coffee machine me to recognise that for it and it'll play back Good morning how would you like a coffee
Right we would use some call there so coffee machine they about interface
i have it's probably more than that you can handle is designed for a coffee machine you notice a hell are in the morning
is the design for a coffee machine

Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them which it just
which it just until you stop scrolling and then just ways that station all them at once the
which that they could be chargeable batteries if there's a base station thing and on top of that
So do you have to bite the things that by nine that and the base station
It's like a telephone handset is there and the base a station for the telephone handset they're so now
it's people would find out what's it even if it wasn't a recharging station even if they didn't have to buy for batteries
basis station is nothing more just it's that by which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket on which the things it's
the basis station base station
or whatever base station extra on the side

After they want something new technology it technologically speaking It's about the
and whole thing not just a watch channel and the way it fifteen doesn't have that logic in it is
But it's important to have two scroll-wheels because you want one for the channel we also want one for the volume because
it's as a unique problem with television's is that if you have this got this scroll-wheel for the television the but and the tv s not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll so
all them at once the scroll and have a quick glimpse all that even if it lights behind what they're doing
so with the solar button you can say skip i have channels if if i'm going from scrolling possible in united some
But then you have to have a template every channel four hundred channels you
and on top of that we can have solar cells and the
and scroll button but push technology for channel selection volume control and they need exposing these are the three scroll
anyway we are not using maybe advanced technology lcd has already been
so going to have that also you all as you suggested that we have some wheels to control the volume the channels and the old to
so you need one here and one on the other side so yet volume and channel and

we decided not to go for speech recognition technology just because of some reasons and all honesty say
is a technology that we can add keywords speech you were it's
worth but it doesn't really add much to the functional Designed and it's it's not mature enough To use as a speech recognition engines
i if that's speech recognition is even if we can do it it's not really appropriate for a television and running
In that case maybe the speech recognition the speech thing to be useful just to say i'm here but
It's speech since the since it's speech not really speech recognition that button matching

one is the basic chip and then regular chip in banana that advanced chip so we can
so we can have regular chip all control rising is a factor
rising is a factor for us that so we'll go for the regular chip
And a regular chip supports speaker support so this functionality
but the speakers actually attached to the chip in some way or is it just the signal
So any issues so where we place this chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana
it should be in one would be the case the chip a lot is going to be sitting inside
but the speaker is actually on the chip then if it's too far away from a the casing was the casing is too thick then you may not hear the the speaker
answer is that hearing is concerned are we can have some gap at some place so that

instead of you is that the hot out of a device which can do all many things idea why a switch these days and to watch to see
because they are more all parental newly like new devices and
board so you can have things like are on a cylindrical device that may be difficult to can have to build
so i received an email i'll and lunchtime they know that the bring in mind to the technology division has developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit
as the sample sensor sample speaker
Sample sensor sample speaker it means that
this is just a mall like a point is devices that
still a what you mean what can have a little extra things to support additional devices like bci dvd players which are usually a touch with the tv because
the the we the basis a extra for the functionality is such as the wheels the speaker you need so that in on the list but the device and
the device and the government you call it

this would be about the conceptual design If i come back
It's designed it design as a fun thing that
you can but you have to pray you do it is a fairly simple design so you'd have to record into the device every possible combination
this is x this could be genetically engineered for it is designed to be square so they'd attack start it in the boxes
I see soundtrack for the kid is the design
that's card application i would presume
i would presume that it's they wouldn't design of the hand a hundred things so
I that fits in with the spongy design philosophy
in a missing israeli fancy and fun Using is
that's we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design as to keep the speaker personal that's
maybe fun and if you teach works we go for the range one

so the the car investigation on the outside a cat and
most what they find more interesting more important needs a fancy look-and-feel instead of a instead of the car and The car and train which was for the functional look and feel so old
look and feel so old now More more core aspect not more hard core that aspect rather than a devise ways to many phones times on many buttons with instead of
And so in a in the usa they got trend them all the most popular feeling it's is a spongy
i've got into the to a beep or people are more the devastating never find a fancy look and feel down in the technology gonna be know in innovation so
in united some you could have a little red light that comes up and i press that so they feeling it's really going fast or whatever
but a good thing you want to move feels slides you're
for the traditionals use traditional uses we can have the pushbuttons so that they don't feel that it's in the in thing for them
so pushbuttons the traditional users so that they don't feel the and i needed list
so this functionality could be used for pressing the mobile phone which has been misplaced
we'll have a rf for for a beeping probably being we need a rest
is in house and now you don't want the traditional uses to be apprehensive all this
And i if it would cost a lot just feel five watch

what they found in other of importance from leicester more important is that People want an easy to use device
Spongy means people easy
a net at economic and oranges
in my opinion we should for goes on young people because they are
and also be a according to a marketing people or nineteen ninety five percent of young people are worse
some people might get annoying if we if we just dump but
very you may even be from mice for some people more functional and then carmine but if they have these scroll-wheels
So it could be co of so it could be convex can be concave depending on what people want

ctv you need internet connection and you need more thing is not just
that plastic you can have the book but the side not the materials we cannot that the book
So there was a there were many other materials like wood be done in and all those things but plastic
but plastic as a thing is that most appropriate one it'll ring the cost down
if you take like quality wood that's got a grinding you put some of an agenda
it depends you have the outs the wood itself was not gonna break so you'd
you could also it you can't just a very thin veneer of wood as
but it's more easier to do a banana and plastic then it would

in eugene In the eighties and he back This In that
In that is i'm in that is and need and they kind and then all of a feature a rough loads for the tools and this
it means that you can recognise it can be like a match on on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back the phrase in response to that but
it's a real recognise i he was but he was in a set not like a freight you train
like a freight you train it for a certain for a certain phrase you say
just to adjust to play back something
Only like the sense that you can recognise a set target what and
but that can we use it for so ten or fifteen territory
combination just to train it's not the law and channel fifteen and whole thing not just
four hundred channels you have to be a tool to recognise

If i come back to the minutes of the last meetings
so maybe we can would be able to clarify this these questions that they had in the meeting we
had in the meeting we should take a decision on that point
So hopefully that story speak if presentations we had that's sold
sold Each of you have some presentations presentation to perform
but they're still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production components
not gonna break so you'd have to worry too much about the case been broken is the
the case been broken is the inside but
so will this additional it will be might be having slightly better market for us
so now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries that rechargeable batteries so all the period of car find him to cut the cost
right but all these things are usually in house so we don't have much problems so component costs
default be forced the findings a meeting i like to draw some sketch about the costs future part of that before
and going to ripple it's all the ideas we've had we had doing these presentations just to draw some sketch
just to draw some sketch about so which would be the pro the final product and that were strip
means reading we have to close the meeting a few minutes so
marketing expert i have to go to product evaluation

this fascinates It's freed and they this thing is free time this it was
They do you think we can find that the shape of a fruit which is handy to use
It has has a mark friends as big as
microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big deal
one for the volume because it's the volume is it's it's very handy for it to have the instant feedback and response
cells and the lighting conditions are good that can be useful it'd be pretty in a week of kind
like when you say double curve would actually menu
would actually menu and you could like drawer something on on the whiteboard though
So there are flights there a single curve and they're double go so these are the three things and
I do a set it that's a switch with the double your four is you have
Banana it's more handy or as compared to the setting and to get to come
it's a pretty handy feature
because gonna be a little bit difficult to make it steve like the texture of an hour anyway and take to have exact shape i
I what the i've been doing these wall or a sporting keywords but everybody's and saying it's volume up volume down

so today is I work third meeting this would be about
the example they said that they have up and running with the prototype is but actually integrated
I get let's move on right so studies running
we have to work to do was to go to move forward so let's
you do you have to work together to mall the first of first prototype
Is that the city's would not be possible to implement it for the next prototype so it's

How do you wanna nicely with twenty five euros
it but means we can consider this from a a theoretical usability committee point without worrying too much about how to develop that because we have this already done
we decided that we can and spend twenty five euro
not spend but charge idea
shape if you'd and not be out the door probably you may as do it in a style as way that just looks a bit more twenty first century route and sixties and seventies
But like target a very high means fifty million euros is that profit which we want me
Twenty five twelve point
twelve point five is a profit on one
