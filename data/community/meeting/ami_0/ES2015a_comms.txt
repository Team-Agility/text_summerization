This is the team building time where
time so that's the time for us to bring our initial ideas any Suggestions that you may have so far and

talk but fish eye feature or i'm That
That i've control talk and cepstral
I draw talk at school

that's pretty on the line to buy a wanna be look at it for about two minutes or we should have a camera
uid the technical functions design will be worked on the next thirty minutes
thirty minutes Maybe how this can be achieved and

times our next meeting will be in half an hour said half
half an hour said half an hour to think about what you want to present or
you will get specific instructions of what to do the next half an hour and i'll

We can Like the price to create it will be significantly less
so you just have like the number buttons power but in tv video but in

One thing that so are we going to do is become acquainted with be that will so we have access to for our project one
With a microphone so test where but it's a cat
It's really big arsehole you going out of its head
they can really overcome harsh terrain there and
there and although would score just it's also very dangerous because it has strong antlers and
a lot but i like also to animals that further when i'm gonna draw a cat in memory of mine look at that point we cd
