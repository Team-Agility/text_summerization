a wide scale of remote controls in the world and
I haven't come to your remote i've got some images of remote controls were
were not very trendy or just Just a remote control like everyone knows i
was the technical side of the remote control
of remote controls gonna be easy
Remote control is nothing special a nonissue
know it's really depending on how far the remote controls are already in the the euros
ask whether common remote control looks good or not about
it's becoming more clear what remote controls gonna be in that
gonna be in that already talked about maybe you familiar with your remote control that has the can opener underneath it we're
the but the functions are not in the remote control we're making
there are a dozen of dozens of remote controls that have
If you grab the remote your hand should be on top plus
them maybe it should be remote control when you clap your hands it makes a noise or some to thing
the like the can open it may be contains some future date you don't normally linked to the remote control it's very
it's very import because we gonna make such a basic remote control we have to do something to make it special it's gonna cost twenty
a in the base or we could like make up a button and if you push it the remote control it's else makes noise there's
fattening and then you can always find remote control but
we use it is in the most costly the remote control we can save
ed for twenty five euros people want something remote special form remote control and
i for that everybody who buys remote for women a couple of months they will be in the situation that they are seeking for remote control wanna see something quick and it just push the button and it really
i have to say i have to stuck can opening remote control i have most of the hour it's

about willingness to spend money on a remote control about
and elderly people want our market or less interested in a features but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls
so you talk about the elderly you are willing to spend more on the remote control and were interested but
or just different colours or i if people also wanna spend more money on phones for their remote control could be
but when you can imagine a when you spend twenty five euros a remote control it's basic remote control and then the money it must be money to spend on that just rechargeable six units

I'm gonna make a decision on the remote control functions we have forty
Regardless of what type of functions we want to implement doesn't really matter
but it that's very important still what so what functions there are we want to put in the remote control
most not of volume and the mute function and an extra previous channel there's
That means we can discuss on the remote control functions
control we can implement more functions then because
you can make some discussion the distinctions in what cut and no that just in functions you have I
we should the put some functions for other maybe for other quick madonna but just
madonna but just the basic functions maybe like rewind and wonder what the what do you guys
what do you think you'd issue we implement features that of functions that to control other devices know you don't think
also numbers to to go to the specific channels
it's a very rare a special function
i if we have to stiff specifically name all the functions mean we want
So maybe it is that's when when we decide and this type of functions know basic functions it's very important to find something like that so it's not
it looks trendy and say this to put a bleep function in it but
control we can save on the functions we just put
and we can deliver that it would be the record should functions because
So easy function as we'll all work that out stepping
Some of the extra functions over your number

somewhere we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic tv functions
to be honest if our la group is till forty not a lot of forty maybe that's not very no we don't really need to have a simple remote control i
other because they want a simple design and no other functions and just if you but taste do aim at the younger format
if it's too simple word that they won't use the remote control they use their own the bit lot more functions
And it's just so that a compliment area remote and the universe want if you want to keep it simple
if you want to keep it simple you can make a universal remote
and it's just when you jump on the couch you pick up the remote a simple one just to put on television nothing more
so we have to choose for the simple design i
Now but we don't have to when we don't want to control other devices it makes it even more simple
we just put some simple button and make it they can sturdy

control about setting be handy for and and like that I i
other functions like audio settings video settings sound settings are not set to be very important and a very much used for them or
All the settings about how do you settings video settings and channel settings which are not very often used We could group them one button And and make them accessible in one menu button or whatever because there are
Some of the new requirements make some of your findings quite set irrelevant
that you can make very you can put very detailed functions regarding the tv set on your remote controller with two audio settings and a screen settings we don't want that
in a lot of tvd players have some tricky settings with

for them or fifty percent says they only use ten percent of the buttons on the remote control that doesn't
that doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off but It says we should make it to complicated Fifty
Fifty percent also claims to have lost the remote control very often in the room and
in the room as i as i said do my presentation fifty percent
but at s i found here fifty percent was it fifteen
percent was it fifteen fifty percent
Fifty percent off and loses remote control

There were hundreds or one hundred people are How do you say watched using remote controls and usability lab
usability lab and they also fill out a questionnaire with a few questions i
Three out of four people claim and to find remote controls ugly so
We shouldn't implement too much features on on our remote control because the elderly people will that last group features
group features for a higher usability
and we gonna discuss and What features we find important
and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or
but they're not relevant because we're are aiming at a young or
at our company already cells remote control to older people but we also want a new customer group that's the one we haven't
one so maybe we can Make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group but isn't that for more person you our corporate
because the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology in their form
no people younger people more looking for just a trendy look then more functions
be you could to speed or a speaker sixty speed is sometimes
difficult is not a very common function and people who have to read up on their remote and
now but a lot of people like to have such cat and i date things to them should
your something is on maybe with balancing pets which you can just throw it on the for something that has to be something

method of the remote control is electrical energy it activated
energy it activated chip in the remote it's an electrical circuit
it's an electrical circuit Which compose messages in the form of infrared signals to control the television
it's a common technology like the circuit board
the circuit board it's the most important Part of the remote control we can use
because after all the televisions there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with a new functions but
No is it just signals And the television the there's the rest
I the can opener it is a brilliant idea actually because television and there is not the right combination
Most televisions breakdown before the battery pack the seventies Yes

or one and also it's what's must be clear what the red button like that
and i if there are any if you put more functions more buttons maybe it's come becoming less trendy like that
said buttons are used four hundred and sixty eight times per hour that's quite
Relevance options are power buttons although only used once per hour channel selection
channel selection volume and buttons for text And
in there are a lot of options there so we can really make an now do you say We can spare buttons over there And
And if you want to implement vcr and dvd options group them in the button not to
that maybe so but we can't just leave the teletext button off it's impossible
We have to zap buttons the volume should
volume should we do we make them very big the said button that is
the plus an a minus button should be quite present
i the buttons should make it possible to zap through the channels a rabbit ever pays
a big buttons flashy design And maybe some cages thing
but what we were here when it gets lost how do you press the button to man

or skip that part time
but is it is a big that distinction between this time for most we should
that the remote control should only be used for television otherwise the project becomes more complex which endangers time lot of time to market So
maybe it's made it's something to them but most of the time these functions don't support a particular device as as their own remote control in a lot of tv
out-dated we just want to see what programs are all on and what time it is probably i
it has to so people wanna buy it they have to think about is more or less for a long time will really gonna use or not some
swap a ball front
swap a ball front or whatever
maybe you could when that's when it's too costly you could probably skip to recharge it with you what you do
but then it's very easy to make it also are rechargeable that i don't think that's gonna much to make it also recharge function in it
such thing in the first thing we most like a whole thing to tune to skip is the pear we did recharge function if that's too expensive
time and they don't want to have ever have those problems in you want have if you have to rechargeable you don't have to
in when one time goes by and i never put them in a recharger of thing last one often that put it on site they can use it now and when it again

Welcome at the functional design meeting again presented by martin
may we should start with that technical functions
and you to some technical problems i have and digitise the last meeting minutes make
we're going to talk about the working design
You don't think it's a problem to design the technical part of remote controls gonna
what i was climbing in the previous meeting
in the case of this simple remote control the technical aspects which it won't work so out already but it shouldn't be a problem then
be just the design of the shape or some gauge it's future work who was something about
It's lunch break and then we have thirty minutes of individual work
make an A part of folder for the minutes maybe that not everything
the first one and when you go write a second it it is it's not working we try the right second paper anyway

opening we've got three presentations and i'm gonna show you some
and i'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements that were sent to me I'm gonna make a decision
Or is it you dump the file in the initiate the project documents folder if all rather than that
Alright i've done some research for a functional requirements
then we i'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and we gonna
presentations we know about the new project requirements
was thinking about putting in the in mind concerning the project requirements would use is we should focus on the tc then

and they're we have to focus on the one hand the experts if you all or none of issues
one though we should not compromise but we choose for expert few or no first
if you want try you which markets if you want to reach you use markets like elderly people mu have to choose form of issues butts i don't
euros was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets and i
One than the marketing expert can do something about the current market
so if you make a trendy design and we have seventy five percent of the market which we can reach
the most important customers which is over seventy percent of our market is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old and
and a trendy look all the all seven percent of the market is consists of elderly people at who don't really care for trendy look so whatever i it can do no harm to make a trendy for the other thirty percent
plus new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty so you
I don't really agree action to be honest it's a very small market
it's a very small market which we will project and if we want to reach customers younger than forty it's
it's only like thirty percent of the total market made
but is it is a this is the fact that bigger market you're talking about we already covered at our company
easy market we have to do something special ed for twenty five euros
because i have about less used of more often and even small pencil holders for something are more expensive
Yes for you want program should be there i because your hand so you are ends will be in the small a part

So maybe we should leave all dvd a vcr or latest features of completely
We have different equipment in your room like a ticket tv or the dvd player you can
the dvd player you can knowing that you can make
some fun i know that the younger people most likely have a dvd player they want to
but we have to think wood with think dvd i've i ellen but they
ellen but they from my experience is kind a lot of dvd players like for reading goes different be you could
maybe if we just leave the dvd function alima

Nothing restrict that's for a user interface
That it's very much depending on the user requirements
once i've received from the account manager
we can put functions shane it's one when we get a user requirements and we can updated
And three out of for users it saps all rsi court of hear from the results I said buttons
Because in this is as good that's a good two additional requirements for work
that's why lot of do you do requirements the account manager send me there are contradicting each other because they want
No the user requirements of the new pretty i was told is not too But maybe
User interface cc
it also for you maybe we should it's very when you can be and try to include trendy in a row as a friend user-friendly as a big

Or maybe you the batteries maybe we use large battery source for one rose
lc don't even need batteries because you can make it a try should hold
day i've never seen that before you make it and they use you'd with the mother the mouses nowadays
at let's read you can recharge its own never have the battery that's one fattening and then
What what a remote controls nowadays can last two years three years with two batteries
an else you would need a battery in the base unit as as makes it kind
in wood people just think about a never have to buy new row batteries again for it because it's very annoying when you batteries and tno in when you
no in when you have the batteries round and probably for two we should be with and spare that
I it has to be room has to have a round forms
And and then spend base unit underneath it is also round
Maybe wrap round brown's
our next next individual round was half an hour

no technology can make the cost very low
our current customers are within the age group of forty plus new product
our corporate image should stay recognisable in our product for product corporate
product corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in use at something
that's more for a fun age range of ten to twelve or whatever
it's gonna cost twenty five euros
If you do that but i if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half euros i have a in
It should only cost twelve and a half euros
but the twelve and a half euros
but then you don't have but that's not something it's in the production someone so one time supposed to single cost them

I don't like this big black board are one of the side
in the world and the components are very very cheap
it diodes about batteries and that a led lights are needed and they're as they're available against
or maybe do should have a big a light that can flash for something on it or
they can make or probably some cheap for light thing around it or that did it that it lights up it's also
Yes less lights it's the sites and site like that
Maybe lights also around the volume and the plus minus program buttons
but i also meant to the blinking light we know the ones that also blink when it tries to a locator remote

we can use for that fibreglass with copper wires is
Can you might as fast as printing paper it's
they said that it teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet
so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext browsing like on and off and don't make
it's just you want to be able to make use of teletext button that's to play with it that much shall we have to think of
But you can put a play and stop and then all rewind
remote control for television you don't need to be able to program the vcr to start recording at three pm or whatever just play stop
just play stop rewind and fast forward

useful if you have a page which consists of more pages and you are not a very quick read or
Then it's very irritating it in the next page shows up but
you look for some bow a couple weeks ago i looked at for the slides and there are a lot of slides in one page so if it is
On this on the zap buttons you can put it to eight to x is all the same page is if you have
lots of newer televisions can store pages and you can just get menu it through them using i
