we went for one to about the look-and-feel for the remote control we went through
I'll fall remote control that you had all the
Actually whatever the video is just to get some far off or you knew that so remote control
say two i don't think at any stage in my life i would wanna banana remote control really
a sense if you read any that's a remote control all the you Would change your remote control for that for anyone
because the other twenty five your remote control probably gonna look
three my remote control is gonna have time is pretty terrible if it was
if it was to have a remote control of my dvd player from another none of them not be more inclined to put it
So maybe you should we should do kinda evaluation In the streets like asking to in people's you like to have a button of the remote control
Some more tender our remote control instead of just for causing on the on tv

do it they've got the buttons changed see if they are function depending if it was teletext or not
So and last question would i change i would change
would i change i would change my a week remote control from and the room and
i've maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because we change the channel time but

which is in like a that read a position for enough for pressing can actually
This is the teletext button so what you press that
so what you press that then you get teletext and you can use the channel
then you can you have like a little a number selection thing you press that's the
you press that's the teletext button to move between the field and you can
you can press the first teletext button and then you can
So then both the scroll buttons they have for teletext closing
that usually there is a teletext button and to press that the channel buttons they about to become the scrolling buttons
Or can move between positioned and and the number
So maybe they would we can we should just take to a giraffe eating we can have the the help of these numbers which is that we should go for it

And also the use of the base station for battery which charging and also to to got a lot more remote control when it is lost
We've first that's all we made a an attractive base station with a banana leaf a look-and-feel on and
but normally with you will just stay on each station briefly so you can see the picture
in the And the base station we have the button up from for for calling the the no
I really do have the solar cells are actually necessary anymore very charging base station
but you people don't like to put it back in a base station all the time people we wanna leave it on the couch so
And that much money really quite for the base station or just not there
base station is made up and many units of a few

get that we have a presentation of what the type of you to sounds interesting
And we have a a presentation of a variation could say about all the marketing expert then we have to
which one on the dollar for the volume and one for channel and
This is when you scrolling the through the channels you can tell it to skip past channels that you quickly brother
one to present any data and then the scroll buttons more for telly takes the normal for channel or volume
It may scroll features and i New features that right
For a tv the most important feature which have it was the locator which is a quick feature and then the scroll buttons
and then the scroll buttons are reading would features we don't have a cd for

when you stop scroll and the wheel it stops but normally with
and you can use the channel selector scroll-wheel was
the field and you can the scroll the number back and forth so it has you carry you scroll to seven and then There is your and then you can
scroll-wheels but maybe was apart from not having the extra buttons when you real if you do need them to summarise but
we didn't think it's not about to the united the scroll-wheel pushbuttons
but because you could potentially united be pushing it down as you scroll it for the senate other but that other button does
so we can go to scroll to project evaluation
just to do the circuit board though using inside i'm not
mean we have is to push buttons and to scroll wheel so we really need
scroll wheel so we really need an integrated circuit to

so rather than having an extra button for for the on off switch we'd just use that a lot
So we are targeting a segment which is just really trendy thing that they don't care about the buttons anymore
feel like you're crazy teenager and you like to find a single
people in the in milan and in paris and then again a button and
Because it would also be in this into out there and find out if we have a marketing really young children as to see i have a market this thing
So it but it's that's something we need to work on next time is really finding out more about the target Market

if you take the banana a search and you press the double working so it's which was star search on so tv
It's to have enough because i'm not married tv that issue
I what they need to have the sufficient work for the whole room or you rub or
time but maybe in some households where there's been a tv for each kid then banana remote control could be fun for them as as pro
go that's actually something that should be in the ocean too Is the ability to to control things of them a tv and not
of them a tv and not just a white equipment but the whole environment of the room

the remote itself that's it's ergonomic if it's in the hand we've got to
Hi and then you stop when you stop it stops
it a six like that it's probably more handy that my car remote of the scroll-wheels but maybe
It is handy it's handy but it's terrible I
it's handy it's ergonomic but it's a banana
why don't i don't see the difference between kinetic handing out

then we have to go to findings evaluation of the costs of these think And hopefully
But he's saying costs not production costs
sound no we have to on to his teammates at the costs so
while going to calculate the production cost we should
but that other button does add that extra cost
a good reading it's just optimal what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to
Production department to make a report that we can use it on to worry about it

And we are having the speakers regular chip for control pricing
chip for control pricing is was the fact that so that's where we are one put a regular chip or may not the advanced chip
So we have the regular chip on the print it just one

simple so that those buttons that's what the latex which is usually also the case that
using that would is using the u the very be simple big that's simple
big that's simple thing is like the voice recording and everything so

and this and the basic station is going to have that as input from the on line for charging the battery it's
i if it did as if you live in switzerland really thin
You mean charging you by shaking the banana
and then we are on budget except for what you like ten cents
Is that include charging circuitry and the thing

so following decision to Make dealer to make a banana
So it always means whatever the race goes bank they get reflected and then you're having a better coverage it's like
and we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana Otherwise it's
It falls got play some put them on the top yes and that's like that like that but
so and we must Users must say it if it's true or is it or if it falls in a scale of ranging from zero to seven
Was not a universal remote then would focus
then would focus was that the focus to some tvs
we decided against solar cells
Installed rubber let it be plastic
so it might be ninety sentence for the remaining things which the court and everything to go
And but one thing we them instead of this all process was a Like a focus group with the actual people without the thing we needed some
the thing we needed some of these young trends that it's play with a banana And i see if they

wood to just forming decisions
The whole ncd no speech recognition technology we went for one
that's that's that's form and function in the one no object
I opened the narrow think it's pretty good to if i were to narrow but
So form and whatnot button supplements right

so there was a constraint that the surface area which we have one to spend on one side because of the shape
Alright now here's the sixty million dollar question twenty
twenty five euro question
of the most difficult question for the end
If i had that if i had to spend twenty five euro Is that was like mile that maybe a lot but because the other
Because they last two questions as much more important than the rest actually otherwise

Calls all buy them in common
so that i get price use it for your call you for each country's it's more like
these all these awful colours call and special form special colour of a special material so

So we should have our final meeting about the detailed design and off stage design of the product of the remote control
going to quickly through the minutes of last the wiki get that we have
if i go quickly to the minutes of last meeting
What happened balls would be could be useful in the meetings with it
i dissected that i used of the telly a base and they designer user requirements and it's cute ada's
and it's cute ada's We we are lady it's a logic so
so i prepare an exchange next sheet

And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this
So folder possibles you still you what we want to usable sense of batteries
Hold on that all hold on the batteries no
this is a mini set a specific a sense
rechargeable batteries would take care of the power thing to bring
it just i miss the signal and the receiver

And hopefully that we should feeds That are get out of twelve point five you're
maybe health and safety aspects
Means let's say this can move down the larger digits and this can move that's more digits
what effect we use the whiteboard and the digital pen that much
