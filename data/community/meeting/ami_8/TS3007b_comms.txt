but it came out that a lot of buttons were and even used on a remote control so
a remote control so you can have a remote control full of buttons on those numbers of buttons but if you don't use
Just to get less buttons on the remote control to make it easier and quicker to learn
keep the primary buttons visible and make a remote that

i do we want to use a menu display on the tv or
is if you use and then we display on tv you can simply pose a i'm a menu and then select the options you want to have and press it so that's my
if you use many options in one but so button display the menu on the tv and the ones
all tv so you have to display on the tv
a remote and the displays all your a menu options

but what i did think about was when you mentioned about the cup folder is one of the introduce a speech function for like where is the remote if somebody says where is the remote
as possible or at least the one display them all at once on the same remote if you have fifty functions
them or at least put again somewhere on the remote where you're not in a way for the most important function

so it's and that's not it's not gonna be a multipurpose remote control so
is that they one the slogan and and the logo to be recognisable in the remote so
people use to Get lost of the remote control or so
what i did was i the second the current remote controls and
what i did was i'd check their remote controls and
remote controls and d remote controls are they are all infrared michael probably
that would mean a cheap remote control for us
we should be able to will the relative to be cheap the cheap the remote
if somebody says where is the remote then it goes beep the beep

the remote control switch alone only be used for the television so it's
the point that you are one use one control or for market that we eat she television so you must
the functions the like the menus or the parental control must be all by the done by the remote control and not by the television that's a point what's

no and the thing about that is the remote controls i have to access tv or a c area and does
that he means that maybe by some option Make that the remote control on tv match and
you can use when you have you call it to be synchronise the remote and the tv then there's always
that they all have to be programmed to fit your tv and
and if you look at them mails from universal remotes there are maybe you can three four onwards tvs at maximum know if you have all of them all the old and new tvs some not so i
But on the on and On the other hand if you have a remote and buy new tv that is an incorporate in remote

on the infra-red so if we want to build it and remote control or with bluetooth then the tv should have bluetooth to in order to communicate so that would mean
and so in order to receive the signal from what's on tv and such so i see that could
and the remote cannot receive anything but the remote to
because it in order for the remote to process something from the tv like to synchronise in you have to send and receive and that's

that would be as the components extra designs larger the remote control is
so if you going to design remotes that looks good it's it shouldn't away over the if it's possible to make but also the user-friendliness so

Do you use that one button for multiple functions like example pressing
there's other side user won't be thinking what did the button be press on what happened i press a
i press a button but nothing's happening
button but nothing's happening on the tv so is
the tv and the ones use combination of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times or five seconds is

And that's partly because a lot of tvs have different menus and when
and when you have a particular menu at your device it could be that Don't correspond to the menu what's actually on tv
but then we something like a touchscreen couldn't could make more menu up pop up
the menus i'm not identical for a for all tv so you have
tvs so this wouldn't be an extra feature to incorporate them and menus of this

it simple make clear buttons easy to use for
use big clear buttons not too many
something so they don't you don't have a big thing full of buttons for

it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy the new technology like an lcd screen on the remote control Speech recognition
first point is seventy five percent of the users find the most report remote controls very ugly and
and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy
because On one and You make the remote control compatible for older users just by scaling up the pictures it's the

and those interrupted by the device from this case television
our remote won't be able to work on all televisions and that would
if the user is pushing a button you should know if television or in the at least remote reacting and not just the batteries maybe no

but should we spend money on and time on building a receiver in the remote control that would be
time and trouble so much but where when you start building something like this you have to build receiver into the into the remote because

Second findings Out of the questionnaire are the opinion You opinions all the audience about current remote controls first

of an l or parents or grandparents picks up the remote from the little chart and it was all in the system functions you have to have the possibility to turn off the tv or to switch to channel without using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions

I see my button is still standing tall
this case is which is a button when a button
a button when a button as brutal pushed in like the current go through here and
but in like i said use one button format multiple functions wall or
wall or just hide a few buttons
just hide a few buttons for all of treating an open you use all your and i don't although
and if possible the buttons should give them a drug direct action but first select
you just have it a few select the buttons and a few menus and do
a button but we have to look at what's our target are audience we

if you wants to it as puts tv on standby or change channels should always be possible to not force change menu
not force change menu options or switch something
but some make it a separate option menu so that's it's

We mentioned improving functions what so what do you mean by that what do you
what we have to keep it simple not too many get chips and functions is like you said
i am going to give a presentation mode some of the technical functions you design and the usability function
so maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to where to keep it accessible want
here is it just see a menu from a system functions or a teletext functions and just choose one and then
traditionals and The the other functions the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen but
Export maybe an export function

but at the moment that teletext is the best thing you can get on tv like getting information so
What do you think about incorporating bluetooth or radio receiver in the place all the next to the tv connected to the tv
No we just connect the tv type that to a set of options just in a memory so that if you
already digital information is sense it's too would the standards tv connections you can see what's
channels so maybe we can send that information along with standard tv

according to a frequency of use first as importance investigation Falling buttons are most important
and in the second table the importance of those buttons and
but the important buttons and make them always accessible and push a ball and clear and maybe use

it simple but that if you want to do that then you confiscate the fact that there will be buttons which case so more options than one
do we want to use a few options and might not be so original or a multipurpose a three part or
It's maybe an option if you use an lcd or a touchscreen
So maybe we'll lose a few option a option but
work at once and more advanced options maybe put it's somewhere away on remotes behind a little little thing or not screen
Like double some or telephones use and maybe it's possible that to flip them open and just expense the number of options that are normally visible
and maybe you can look out if there's options that the remote and it's very can see what colour tv this philosophy
this philosophy that's this in that and then give the options that are capable of the cable
The memory but Pops up the options

build we shouldn't make a big remote control for a simple functions but we should
but if you display on lcd screen with them really big numbers
My xxt f a big room with a pain

see the third thing is when you buy a remote you set the channels the
if you a lot on the remote to the to channel fifteen channel fifteen on this television is different than ten or fifteen on a television so that would be
kinda but maybe if you'll all be in first as a parent you address the channels and
and like a hours channel fifteen that's

Especially the important buttons and if you want to switch channels change your volume use teletext it has to work at once and
if you want to change the volume or the channel but there's always accessible an ec and other functions
that's being a parent that the children cannot use is the change the settings of the tv like caller and then volume and
screen so they want the normal functions like teletext volume changing and it to be traditionals
then there's always they're always possibilities to change the colour and brightness and the volume and

We have to pre you improve the most used functions As i said here switching channels teletext and volume controls
just in the middle the general functions like play Channel switching and then
but children show and the pink all they can switch to file and the channels or

the idea about touch screen is very good
and they have like the touch screen with a really big pictures on or like cold hang up
Then what's gonna be displayed on touch screen
If you make one big touch screen
and use the lower part of that screen for the rest
So you think it will be better to have a total touch screen
to use just for special options a part of the touch screen
i wanna a question about a total touch screen or
because elderly people maybe are not used to a touch screen so they want the
on the touch screen but to keep this as a normal as possible to keep it accessible
display actual buttons on the touch screen
A touch screen like microsoft will already develop something like that for multimedia Applications
There are signs a for a screen so that's Directory

structure so that would probably mean lower cost and
at the c but maybe using a dog higher structure And
you mean you have to a rat to keep in mind that several tvs that don't even have a menu structure or they have
structure or they have a very simple menu structure so you
structure so you have to keep in mind that not all are not our remote won't

it's processed and then a sender infrared bold way that
current tvs can't even send infrared

or so maybe it's an idea for us to design that place folder a sign of the off the tv when you can put
if we have to stick with going technologies and we have a restrictions of what's it's on the market today you should keep its ideas use
but if you pick the idea the left idea
i have another Idea about maybe parents all control
idea but that's a little bit later in the state i wanna a question

like example pressing in longer makes a switch to a different function
when it's which is pressed in the work on this case is which is
other thing up with the current remote controls be universal ones you have to press that you have to press a colour for tv
and assess press caught four five in you press
just one docking station where you put it in press
in press start bling updated

first one is they think that teletext becomes outdated an internet
an internet will be the main focus
They use teletext and no internet long remote control that's ridiculous
and if you're looking for teletext you'll be searching for half an hour from

welcome back At the functional design meeting
The plan is that it each one of you sound on me but only you will designed the things you worked on the last l file and i will take
But that's maybe something for the user interface Design
only then a bit about the working design about the project
what's my opinion them out what's most important still combine the design technical possibilities and the user-friendliness in one so
and make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design
and for some design issues put the logo one it's and maybe

but the infrared that button it works only find a chip and the subcomponent do the switch there is a switch
if multiple machines are used create easy switch between the machines but

It's pretty Pretty normal that's what you
that if you did display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal it's all elderly people will to do

people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of tv more than people were l elder
Third point the came out of the of the questionnaire people
Because recently i saw a news item on tv about And new telephones for older people and they have
audience we are aiming for younger people and
younger people and they chose
not everybody has a pc at home the most people

at least the user all the facility say that you have you the smartboards the word files what you whatever you want so
so that would mean extra cost for the user and this
So that's just to the to explain of to do it make it clear to the user
or five seconds is too complicated for most users
if you already told give some feedback if the user

seconds and that's important for the marketing expert the current
i'll show it to you in an a few seconds and i'll explain and it's

them so why what should we inventor we'll spend more time on north
we should stick by with infrared than spending and no deceiving so and
so if we shouldn't be spending time on teletext and things like that because when
so i see that could be spending too much money and time and
you have plenty of time say monday
If you take your time to learn i will eventually

if you have fifty functions don't want fifty buttons to the to be and same time twenty fifth an
twenty fifth an internet site you don't want fifty links at the c but maybe
i have a philips h fifty five and assess

because is one of the discussion points of the preview session the
and when you multiply them you get the these three points switching
That in the middle are the main keys like
it the main points in this in this meeting is how it's going to look with

and in immediate real a bold lights up for displaying to
bold way that will be tc's a evening and
you can they displayed on the old style display
And codes you get a book with the goats you look up
five in you press code four five hour and a remote and the displays

transmitter that's also focus on the infra-red so if
the energy source is connected to the infra-red button but

and persons were asked what the buttons for they use most how much an hour and
my personal opinion is to is not to do a beautiful for all Or radio waves although
the eye on my personal opinion is no to see that
It's time i i had a for the summary on what you told an what you personal
i bring it to my personal room

and then at the top or at the bottom some menus like settings or you can drop down
kids i do one like it's a wise then you set the priority
then you set the priority to only parents

the current cursors are in the age group or forty years and all that but with
that but with this a new remote they will would like to reach a a group are younger than forty
the first one this scale of sixteen to forty five Use an h
and some interests from the age groups it seems like
and then when you see the audience The ages are going up the they don't really wanna do anymore at least a new technologies
we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five

I have some new findings from a marketing expert level
And my marketing department generated a report would lot of results
And that those young people you saw tim i'm marketing report they like the new fancy so
but you have an international market range so
market range so you have it would be great show

at first you have the energy source of energy source will be
of energy source will be battery simple battery that
battery that you could find anywhere i figured that
would be best when the battery stop functioning we could just they use could just go out and buy new one

to use if you want to use a play and back and stop
then you'd be back to the building a deceiving it's actually worth it to do it in it we could actually

now maybe we can incorporate some use p or firewire connection so that
so that you can connected to the pc and download news
and download news from where from from the internet
and you could probably it makes connection to and telephone line or internet connection

on and why several possibilities but we discuss the meeting falls off
this was because of our last discussion if multiple machines
i discuss is it specific instructions for the next meeting you all will receive at do the email i

second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five
if you can see here the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five second
second or this audiences to thirty five percent
first of all It's the biggest share the biggest audience sixty five percent second
it's possible the store this on the shared documents or

so and not more than ten minutes for presentation each at least
time say monday i was down the top for ten minutes so i'll
that after the lunch break it's back to individual work once again thirty minutes i will put
know and hopefully you get it done in the in thirty minutes and i knew
and i knew we'll see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes
Thirty minutes of end right
The question fla we have thought that after lunch
the night do it after lunch I'm angry

The method i used was giving orders to our usability lab and to do a questionnaire
why a chip that's translate it into electrics in electronic signals and then
because when you one teletext on the info that you'd have to build another see the two and so in order

minutes and we'll put the main is i have at the end of the session in the shared folder also the
also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now so you can
at the end so we have now a lunchbreak finally

i had an email from the management board i
But it's strange that the man's board and mention board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet
i've at the this for things from the management board just keep in mind
because all things are us store the smart board dot it takes dk and

Maybe or an update software updates
I it's Most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates that the surf centre at the shelf

And also like clapping Not like a device that it pops open
but you can open from europe or from a laptop

and maybe use it it somewhere i take care of static form but
I'd i don't think that's that takes a lot of storage space for a just fire for rivals

One hundred respondents where fold
be read out a few things ia i noticed were
