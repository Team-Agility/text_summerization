likely to flat so the colour buttons came from
in this one you've actually got three colours of buttons we decided
but that was it was an rr button you're thinking of on the other on the other option it on the second page is it where that say you were thinking of maybe having is a different colour
so maybe different colour buttons isn't so important

so we have decided that we're having rubber buttons and
the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons but just to have the
so you would only have the one special button that was rubber wears the rest

was the apple everything else is gonna be a standard with a special
We do one special colour want visual
our say so just take the special colour for the apple and
apple and therefore that was the special colour
I say it to you just need to fit special colour it's

And so what i've done my thing on the cost a i had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour would be the the red apple button
apple got the buttons the only thing that has really changed is the colouration of the buttons And so
So that would That would work out fine if that's assuming you're correction or are we assuming that one change covers all the buttons and that would be fine And there's nothing

Have a push button interface
So the so that we'll all the real question then we come in Do you make all the buttons
the sole answer is that meant to be all sixteen buttons and therefore
one button and the question was up all buttons or is that just one button our plan
button our plan really was to have one button on a with a special So

What the button supplements originally
that in the button supplements is just a supplement for all the buttons be made in a different material was on a button
which would be come from the button supplements category
and then we could make we can see handle the button supplements

So we've got one special button form which was the apple everything
want visual button form
budget of together something else than to study lower standards maybe get a one the special form buttons on we could have this piece

of all the stick on button with the company will want
if they would just all small amount blue buttons it'd be fine needs to be the end up on
and that's the more functional buttons with a worry too much buttons have that as like a pauses in the way anyway

the volume buttons could be lemons like a
do we decide about one switch button it was the volume ones
we could have a lemon shape ones for the volume of those I wasn't

special colour it's just to supplement show one
show one original colour and then to supplement maybe

so by the fact that we've got to Simple chip and the kinetic energy source we've got a single curved Case we've got to a rubber Case materials supplements so
rubber wears the rest would be hard plastic
So we've got rid of the rubber case paul
that it's hot still have the rubber casing is really f eight
Did did you have to have a rubber case go for rubber buttons or was
He had ever present a rubber case so we can

How much of a difference will it make it for me the case and plastic
Why should we just have a plastic case so we least two points which
colours autoseek that because maybe it's a rubber case a bit less instead of the corporate identity then the in a sleek plastic case
apart from maybe Do the whole thing in that kinda like she of blue like the case and
Just in case we knew that point two four little things so it's like

To say is that we make a slightly more fancy then we these points innovation if
innovation if you make it more in the in the two of them win these points of the being fancy so

so you could do have to do that then you have special form at the bottom line a special colour
line a special colour at the bottom and that
as got a fair to be label on the bottom saying Where it comes from

what we got rid of we got rid off The plastic
paul We've now it's a bit got an extra form an extra colour for the buttons so maybe in terms
but we said there Because you got rid of the rubber we put an extra next to see if we can shape or one of the buttons a lemon

Syria maybe if we go rid of like the maybe one of the special colours controls same colour then we could have the voice recognition results
But remember the idea was to keep the colour of the compare our say so
the warm colours remote another piece of part of rubber isn't it
colour did you get all that the company colour as
in the way that you frame the windows bad joan there it was really doesn't matter what colour is as long
So even if you had a silver The same colour of silver on your display because you've got effectively a double agn on the on the logo in means that it splits off what you're always from the product

to just have one special the only special forms down here
we were that was the biggest are you week and then you got a special
god special form Is the one on all the
So it's if we've put in for another special form on a bone then maybe they could be a different shape but
about the past see this is it's cheaper to make them a different It's as you got we've made it a special form so And that would maybe
is there anything this special forms makes it slightly easiest to To use

with a special material rubber wood titanium extension that so i was
so i was a reserve saying about rubber wasn't special but according
special material the rubber wood titanium makes it true If you go for that's the high end that's point six or as then
same the other thing that can be special material rubber wood titanium

But other than that but the red apple got the buttons
originally it would just be That one in there because it was the one red apple but
colour was actually i was assuming we had the red apple and therefore
the moment you're making a red apple so next
can't just check if that's a cherry or apple did
or apple did we decide against the apple because a lot of work and do we make a

so Oakland of its thirteen point seven is now with everything we want on
point six or as then it to adjust special colours to this point to a are trying
a are trying to lose one point to sell it seems to
gonna be honest with this my head One point
you can lose one point two and still me too The requirements
save point two for profitability that
So we just add that to profitability in effect
give them help or second main point in another direction here at the
I tried to save this last time at twelve point three and it

If we just had all the buttons a standard except for the one that appleton that would take care of that i case We
i we have it was a sharply the moment we just be the standard colour
standard a little what you could argue that should maybe week you were making
we decided that the blue ones were the the standard colour so you were
we have assuming that all the buttons on the second the panel the hidden away but i'll put all be standard
So we aim at first and talk on that skill

and thirteen point seven we do have kinetic the problem
have kinetic the problem is we have to get used them from there to get it going to twelve point five and one way
was it fifteen point seven was that the price was features we set it has

for the other one weird things thrown in the second meeting where you'd look to their remote controls assume that curviness ball in the first one you'd also look to some remote controls and what's the buttons i
when a remote control is and the most fancy thing that you could imagine design and
i was thinking like is be restricted just say that you have to design a television remote control in a layer it depends
a good idea means that the kinetic Remote control and i see what i'm the fall
screens and i'm thinking one key remote control doesn't really fit in they
Kinetic power would remote control

so We have to say with this true or false the product looks and feels fancy
so the first one is Just a product look and feel fancy So if you
Do you feel you got a chance to express your souls one of one

the room and innovative and we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there
But the product demonstrates technical innovation that is
and how much as a product demonstrate technical innovation and
So maybe this has not having that maybe we've lost some mail on the innovation side there

Whether it's incorporate in the fashion elements try to buy a whether
Because we did say that would we wanna follow the fashion too much buttons
And incorporate elements of fashion to try to buy or
sr us a baby put fashion for fashion at three rather than two
And that would maybe keep was Close on the side of the fashion time one and it sort
What i have a fruit was in fashion next year
or maybe liz a point on fashion or two or three

and we have the rubber kinda spongy feel which was in the time
buttons or a might be spongy enough and then it might stand
As a risk of the spongy will bring this is maybe a bit more in a comfortable win can sleek and new age
we've lost overall spongy feel

at the voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got to know battery
but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that could find the remote with the got lost
voice recognition computers are it's not just

the line at the bottom indicates that the power a light pole down and the extra
and the extra function buttons a blue one up on the line of all the stick
it the other of functions with calling arm are more at the
you were making these buttons then the bottom i was presuming bigger than the other ones are worried

This is which is switching on there is on the electronics we got the sample sensor them are we just got a simple
one of the chip and the sample speaker be separate things we need both of them
And if you definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker line because it the other
it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensor is speaker you than having to go for the cheaper options on everything else
and the simple we could do it would be to have the battery To have your sample sensor speaker and then you're looking
sample sensor you but looking to take the point two so
You've got to The sample sensor and sample speaker which is your big item

whether it's recognisable real reaction product and i have
But those are recognisable real Or Reaction product
a lot sensitive Is it a recogniser product is if
Real reaction product i'm not
If you if you look at the product on the website here real reaction there is a pretty high-tech and cutting edge and

Right so and as far as the finances that we can say we can make that the cost by the production cost remember that was one the first consideration has to be and under and had twelve fifty or two and a half at twelve and a half euros
We could do is you'd call on the production costs look at the prototype

So when i want to change it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements and then
with the main thing would change really is the casing isn't it
it is the angle and change things are running

they're separate off think l the volume related passes from the channel or less buttons you got the volume
you got the volume in orange one designer and
maybe the special colour we've got three not just because does the volume and stephan i we have
but it's so think that you wanna pick up the control and just important quickly to change channel volume so
volume so if it's that obvious that's fine if you're mean the panel
if you're mean the panel any look in each you'd and then you pay a bit more attention so maybe

I would just use simple shapes fall them
them are we just got a simple chip which costs want i
the other option if we're planning i'm just going for something chip and cheerful would be to make it then direction that we're gonna make a simple product

so and then the production evaluation as to how easy that would be to to manufacture
And sketch a exactly where it said in the email for Product
products which a coffee makers and spacecraft
but we come up with some book a shot product a way that's
i don't think it at that starting if it to do with the rest of the product so mean

Shall we say we've also the on the fashion in los a bit on the fancy
in los a bit on the fancy senator but generally
so maybe in terms of fanciness and fashion ability we're the same may be so

And wayne I i plug that in last time use remember it has to be under twelve and a half As far as i know that to That took care of the of supplements And if
and then it might stand the test time that
now lots of all the time the combinations would least a little
Maybe for the one the gonna see all the time we make a look at and fit the idea for the ones and that's the more
Yes was a real would you be going out for any more information each time then there's things

do the project and i'm not my way for the moment is acting as a computer

the paul was but she's running out using the these numbers to go with this i
in a sense at the moment we've got a total which we need to reduce the number one point to at least
When you could are you might do it once a year you would change because the moment you're making
and you are the idea is that peak which ever persons and the other end can point in the right direction number two year
number two year doesn't directly give them help or

i the sample sensor sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing which puts up to fall we should be slightly over
whether they would figure the this so the sample sensor and sample speaker voice recognition be so overweight thing to have a list of the patches
a list of the patches or whether they would prefer
it if you have that in plastic rather than rubber than that would enable you to get You could keep a kinetic thing you could keep your sample sensor you

that course i'm a little thought to get the hand the actual labelling on the individual buttons
two or three the local would be more recognisable on the actual thing is
on the actual thing is just a pen would really write on a paper but
more the features of the actual control would be more point maybe than the actual sfs it's

So we've got Prototype presentation we should just an evaluation criteria
And so but after the evaluation criteria is is the finance And the and the cost of the kitchen a missionary right
So he adds to a presentation now we just like on the prototype
This is about the evaluation criteria be used for that the prototype we've got here and
evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we formulated and
So i've got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to identify mental one as at the end
Same function Criteria so i submit

so we've got to detailed design meeting
so i we have to evaluate that meets aspects that we're looking for from our previous meeting so
some of the divisions are between set of the individual meetings where they all the tree
we will find it now various things in in between the meetings and paste
and paste It didn't the ball meeting can always fall on for the other one sort
no the only thing is fine design and manufacturing process you would normally you go to a meeting you say that you do this you do that then you call
don't forget to be final questionnaire and meeting summary then celebration

it's almost curved like option display as the line
Which do you think of which do we think is the more important of the options in a sense
remember that was a minimum requirement the other option
i was is that in a sense i remember that when you look then we've got solar power would not have these are things you could have we're not
so but it but in the sense that as you saw with the windows although back to it doesn't really matter but virtually

Yes i have a false last cherry design at the top
and so the method is the design team mates prototype evaluate
That that straight the email easily
the email easily says it's evaluate the design as it is so
as it is so we need to think about finance a three evaluated that design the return
Do you wanna click india so in get out there The finance
so what i've seen are you are since on to the evaluation of the course of a rather than the evaluation of the project is my understanding or

you think apply think computers like a mark
saying is like a computer have like a range of products and
so what she's doing it she's how to spend handy At the computer channel that one aide so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question and
to this because they were actually trying to debunk the computer software to enable to work and
of the product so mean And call they said if High definition tvd and Whole ball seven inch that like computer screens and

as we deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition if we had
if we had eve of those for our budget the push a reasonable to of speech recognition
And what's got the same am speech feature as the coffee machine
I whether to speech use it they gave me just everything you've written that page after

at the moment and if and we're going to do stand from that but the current one
actually so these are the moment as it stands system
So there is pretty good at the moment but it's gonna get worse is
and a memory that nobody system the current So

on the knee socks more space
if you want to keep kinetic right you've got a choice the logo and the battery we could see if you want You've
that so you're in a sense you're comparing the product without the company logo and then you but
logo and then you but you've got the space for it to stick it on
is as long as our company's logo is frame do in the same way is that what they like black i would like that they've got black
that they've got black and white or black and silver So

reckon that that you wanted to appeal to people and not have to replace batteries
this is the sole the whole technology type thing You're saying in the market as there's people like interesting gadgets and whether they would
that's a that's a new age and it in is innovative Type company that having the kinetic feature in the voice recognition is quite high up on
and desires are the most on this type of pass and

So we've done the The finance but an excel proven that but on the redesign so
redesign so when i want to project process
it made it could've been slightly more creative project when a
you could have used a uid f for rent Example or to increase Create Creativity
But the other thing is that to them in there and casing that they're trying to use this software to To demonstrate how you could do the project and
So that was a project and i suspect similar to this because
project manager you want a leader so i'll

but the current one unit so you would be fancy would be too
in a layer it depends also the business unit i

so next year you could make mixtures model the same but as a whatever a lemon yellow
a lemon yellow a lemon on

the lock does is it a look fancy rather than functional so
but generally speaking the cat the other at speeds to the
here at the library or or come back or go and see child lock or whatever

but have to write on the street to see easiest way
paying seven so if it's not a channel files And that's for
I suppose the easiest way of doing it has to put some notes down the channel two

and i was on the gonna be in response to market research and
So this is about the corporate image of like a new set of sleek technology lots of saying as as having the logo on a lot sensitive
whether that's considered to be set of Part of the corporate identity i

and fall of information On any given subject Subject sometimes disjointed
you go to turn find out Information to see how to get it fixed so what she's doing

satisfaction with room for creativity leadership teamwork means if it's a whiteboard digital pens excess so
It's regular this the whiteboard and it just opens like it's a male
So how do you reckon teamwork world
So one more men to comment on leadership and that means easy whiteboard digital pens etcetera And and new
Pope a really old fairly common on leadership because

Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right hand corner of the little box
