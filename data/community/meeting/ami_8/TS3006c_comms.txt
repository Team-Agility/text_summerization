that we can use scroll buttons for the menus but we already kind
display it on the upper side so that the menu button and maybe some cancel button or save button and
buttons which can hide in the back button and a menu button
button and a menu button also because we if you can maybe if

is the ki and nothing about the buttons but just response thing and some fruit and colours
but the colours you where you can make it so make the colours that let's beneath the buttons if you
You bet it that's better keep the left and the button itself in the same colour i so just an extra
what we should do is make a see-through plastic button with the one coloured let and it's so

if you press a button then you can disable the colour leds for people that don't like it
or maybe the buttons all buttons in red it's maybe better control for colour blind people because of that of the green

and if they're older people they wanted more more lecturers so that's not all some option
so kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people want something
and people want something a different or more design they can go for one colour like
colour also for the more for the older people
And also for people are bit colour blind

otherwise would have a simple chip just for pressing buttons that we need more
or i prefer to be even keep the simple buttons here and then under the screen tv you can put more advanced buttons

also so it's better to have an a some basic print and the fruit print and song primary colours i what
i what colour should the basic print be like some

i sums up all the buttons the room so
to switch form buttons to influence you turn it so that
Those buttons and the simple buttons here for
the press buttons should to be white or black or
that's the default setting the red buttons
we skip this i random button for us
so that the plastic buttons also help because of they're only lit during interaction so
could make and and volume button scroll button

this all very basic at trendy design everybody save it
But this is the basic design for the for the buttons
i have to focus on the basic look and feel design so how it's gonna look

and this is the fruit and vegetables look so fresh bright colours to
bright colours to give you an idea
But only one that make the background the bright colour colours so the total of very bright like

so the buttons are on top here a flip it over that way
you can maybe if you drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will hold expected not to have to make it
So i'll get more but you have to you need some button to flip this open
i and it says menu and a flips open and then you have two buttons to control to combination which are

So are they keywords our primary core colours spongy
if you make it just blink if the blue colour then it's just a neutral colour also
if you use flashing colour so you don't lose it
In which colour should censor that gives the display
i don't it's an has to be sixty fifth a five thousand colour so too expensive so just
So actually pretty trendy colour at the moment

one very important thing i was think about this speech option you are going
But do that jane do we tend to do a speech just for the basic options for the simple buttons for

i have been of investigation again in the remote control market it says
it says for the use of technical feature to that do not existing current remote controls be pretty
And the third developments is that the remote control should be easy to use
more fun i always joke my remote control around so
that's one thing out which i'm not of how to implement it's into the Remote control
that's the primary colours we can creative that that the leds on the remote control if
know that it i remember from whatever first meetings that people lose their remote control so often

And and and control things in the middle the arrows

but it's pretty fresh the other side
all the sites not only in the front side of the top side but also the side view
only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit
because if it falls on the other side it does a file on the screen so there's a
so there's a layer of rubber on the side so
copper right side of the real
that's do we want options on the side it so that the buttons

but we already decided to go for the pushbuttons for the arrow button so that's
or that this a confirmation button that you scroll which is
that you scroll which is done with the arrows and then confirm that will be
it so that with the scroll this is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons

No but it has to be a combined that's a menu for functions and
so that any case that there's an menu under the menu

so just it a blue back light like that green is too
green is too old fashioned not do User guide
Red and green actually the easiest to discriminate even for colour blind they will see one
but if you use it a green blue those colours or will look the same

that the display we will put in here the basic functions and here where it's most reachable the
reread got the basic functions to

so that's a dark blue basic colour i denies
i one that has to be more real dark blue or so the contrast with the fruit of texas are pretty high
and if the background is very dark blue

You can three presentations and then we have to decide on what's concepts a mobile phone has to work for the remote control has to Sports so
they are responsible enough to have a mobile phones also to do with their remote to the control yes

single curved which means that it as curves in one dimension or the double curved
in all that we will have to go for the double curved it's tearing and different from what we have now
so what single curved let's say would be a square box with the with curve someone did mention and double
and double curved would means that it would have curves a curse in every direction like three d
the instead of doubly curved to be take a single curved So to the only the more to the all the public
i'd so we keep seeing week single curve and
but if you make it more curves we can make more options for buttons if you have

the components there's a lot of options that we have to discuss
in the last meeting we are we were putting the simple an advanced options separate it's
pressing the menu option build is able are all older options on your a remote control
the more advanced options are for the menu

And the second most important aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative
the first aspect was twice as important as the second aspect what which was twice as important as the fruit aspect so

type If it the young dynamic people want soft primary colours which looks like fruits you can and shapes
actually we wanna appeal to the young public with fancy with flashy colours and with a lot of shape and
And i'm thinking drawing that's where you have to shape for your thumb so it kind
Other than as a weird shape another fruits also so

And only the lcd panel bill of a light up and then you can only change the the options
of the lights maybe we should consider this function to customise
And how about some some flashing stand-by light it's like
So it meant not only in the colours also that's that we want something to Keep it's visible light all times are
maybe maybe a white back light
Why back light and dark
i do use you should tested under a lot longer lights conditions so hard to
but you need to keep in mind that the lattes are just extra light
Light on it but use it in a user interaction
that's a good thing that's the buttons aren't that there are plastic because then you can light up the light on it when they're usable

for the the case there's the traditional uncurved flat hard case single curved which
and the case would be doubly curved so Rubber
do you have a picture of doubly curved case

cube where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be to hold than
if you have you have your hand you're not only you don't need one dimension but you can use all the dimensions for pressing the buttons
big already and we need something The the that's easy That you can able to use all in one hand
so it's easier to hold in your hand tv
And if you think about easy to use buttons we have to we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold for both hands but also
for both hands but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb if you're all the machine
The middle has to be a very small so you can have it in your hand

but we have hardware inside which is so it has to have some basic shape
It's really make some outliers catches of the basic shape first

the advanced chip Is easiest to implement for the production they can print it's better
we need to the chip on print to be able to support the screen and have audio function

are blue and then very bright yellow banana or and or a it's a green apple like that it's very
we need very primary colours like red bright yellow
And then the yellow and orange and red topics on it but then

vds but this is the simple layout display
that's the only the simple functions will be visible at first and then

for the sides feel that what the basic section would be rather and a bit thicker than the middle way you're holding it with it because your fingers

they gave me an idea about what people ones where
what people ones where it's mainly focusing on this group but i want to make the distinction clear but
it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays
make but it is more longlasting to people don't have to ever buy batteries again
so you can change to make it more trendy for younger people and
And it's also for the children it's for people that sixteen years but there

There's a mobile phones in which you can change the colour also of the lights maybe
i like to call brands phones that it you
remember that the weight pocket phone thing your way it's look like again ball and maybe

public fruit and vegetables
fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothing and shoes and furniture and it feels material
so the fruit and vegetables in combination with sponge material

you did read the minutes i wrote
everything with speech display it sounds everything that in your minutes
i was thinking of that also a minute arrow so that any case that
and they don't eat a minute caller that much
Five minutes left before the meeting and it's

most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel instead of the current functional look and feel
for know original look-and-feel the case and the interface And
so fancy look-and-feel it's the most important point of attention
So i feel rather drawing paint
because they will feel weird if you would make this smaller and it's a bigger that I

see i use some design example so it's from similar products and use
cells but i how we would use that into the design of the actual products so
the sony in design mention like this so
board next thirty minutes to design something so
because you are going to design it's on this board price

the fish over presentation is not we have speech is you can
you can just a match the speech commands if the functions that are already present so

be covered that with our screen and and speech recognition so i don't
and use the possibilities from our manufacturing department about screens components which will have to be implemented in the design that's why it's a
you have it in your hand so it's an angle from your eyes to the screen so then you
How about we do up a pop up screen like the laptop So that's the only
But then the size you can be straight if you have pop up screen but i
the idea of it was is that because you close it you cover the lcd screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever
those thing so if i'm drawing you think i'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there you have to correct a t minus
a t minus the drama black then for normal skies yes
May maybe it's easier to integrate the lcd screen just into this ball

i was think about so read i read let's and blue let's and

the energy source we have four types of the basic battery
of the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move to think you shake it which will be
to go to but i really think that we should maybe a think about the kinetic energy where you have to move the
you can only fit one source of energy on the
imagine that the kinetic a time energy source would be more expensive to make but
so what do we have to decide is what components that we use energy source
so we only we already decided kinetic would be the choice for energy and

but it comes down to what you what you think we should do with the spongy in the fruity looking type If it the
energy source chip type case type and s user interface but
interface but i didn't see a clear distinction between this so what we have is so we only
the interface type supplements
come over here is c this is the standard traditional type where the forum search the function it's like really

As long as you look use like contrast between the background than the foreground colour so
we have to reno me see you have a backgrounds it's number is
partly but you have to train on the number or the sign so

i wasn't able to finish my personal preferences you'd but
i was working on some for personal preferences i
the lower part doesn't work i so
discourage You two are going to work on smart board next
So we're gonna work here on the scratch remote Alright

technolo technological innovation we covered that i
with it and especially when the materials rubber it can be done you can harm it so it's
and the end of rubber it will look cheap always with
But but i look at it will be covered in some thin rubber they are like that

and shapes are curved and not us all it straight lines anymore so there's
Line width So we once the kurdish

that's why i call meaning so that's a dark
it's called the real weemote

and it feels material is expected to be spongy sell
sell the development so i will address and
we have all kinds of arts materials like the hard plastic the wood and titanium i would definitely
So because we need to sell it for twenty five euro a piece that's gonna be difficult

harm it so it's the perfect combination i

would be problem so my point of attention is a space be disbarred that this
They're going to produce it in a china so it's no problem
That actually you offer some extra protection for the
That's when your left hand that's that's a problem

i knew that i didn't have time so copy and paste everything into the
if you want to laugh you can look at the final reports i have
again this time about trend watching
fashion watchers watches i have detected the trends for young public because that's our public
It's not very very strong if you drop as one time and

but i could not Track the pictures into the slide so i don't have examples of how it looks like but it
I got my french a few fruity a picture and also over there

with it because your fingers have to fit underneath

i can't cut the bases into the other folder
i first that shows for the battery and traditional and that's the most obvious easiest choice to go to but i really
which put it in a group folder the project folder
it has to be instead of the playstation in the modular as be like to the game cube where

There's a lot of factors involved in choosing the components there's

you don't have to be scared about pounds get out the floor and breaking it or whatever So that's
exactly we just have to make that the closing mechanism won't break the it's very solid

but maybe you can do the evaluation don't have to evaluate yet which can make a procedure which to fall i
That that's make first the all diffuse the fronts few sites you on the deck few

also and countries where it isn't much like in scandinavia they wouldn't be able to use it a half the year so that's
