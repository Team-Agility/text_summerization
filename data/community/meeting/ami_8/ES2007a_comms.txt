it's tv remote control
And new remote control for tv

see what people want in a remote what buttons we use more often and like that

ideas you want i want one remote that maybe to work all the functions of tv and if you have

I'm not if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote that

that it doesn't have to be really thick every remote controls
thick every remote controls can be within that and

that's true maybe we should just concentrate on having it at the tv remote can have it be

sided remote that it would be very hard to use in the way that you but then you can either
Remote spending from other remotes everyone lasted remotes the side

Experience with remote control so i talk about
Right it on experiences with remote controls and

Project aim is a new remote control To

get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls and then and what we

at the end of the day if it's a it's just tv remote doesn't say come combination with all over

we're doing before we close the meeting was supposed to come up with some ideas for

but the functions that were that we want our that it can control the tv but also devices

we should have a backup plan or just a really good television remote control that just that is just for tv but it's just a really good one

the moment week to remote we this
so it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together by making them thinner and into one

but i get the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it

look at five or six remotes an alkaline on the cat's use

ideas where if you wanna go back to the last slide It's

Project method functional design Individual work and then the meeting conceptual
the meeting conceptual design individual work and a meeting detailed design individual
design individual work in the meeting

and then after we want to find what we can like some different ideas we can end and do research to find out if these any of these ideas or feasible or not so the be

and then on the the sign what one remote control that would be very simple was just the channel program plus and minus and then just the mute button we keep it really

a user name it doesn't have to have a flip function at least have a lock functions so that it's

of tv and if you have whatever associated with the tv the tvd player like that but

So to find a niche for our remote the market it to a certain people
The other one is gonna go find that to the research see what people want

hold like to wouldn't be able to press the buttons but
very or Big buttons for a touchy buttons
causes so you don't accidentally press a button or record buttons

i by the end of this meeting we should have at least A rough conceptual it was stage

Flip it open and you got all the buttons or you flip it closing you just got there Basic buttons on the outside maybe

that in the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer or whatever What ideas where

Industrial design you're the one of you're gonna be working out box it goes in i so

so we start time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface but the functions

like a lot of like a loc facts functional it like you have any telephones

The back end of an awful

it was stage one was technical functions design what affect the

User interface designer that's that's

No but you would slide didn't see some of like something on the back would hold like to

So before we close the were expected that in the last slide

so i that was the test to see if this equipment so working

Next meeting starts in thirty minutes

v but also devices connected to the tv you mean be able to operate

slides and then the call comes compact

how of one very complicated one on one side with all the tvd and dc or excess and and then
we keep it really simple one side and the other side be very complicated
One side kids one side for adults

The what'll make it interesting for people to buy though if it's
