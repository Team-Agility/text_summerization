using a remote control is quite subjective experience
as i said before remote controls all subjective different
say like it at a hundred a new remote control in this

and then we have to make a decision on a remote control functions i will disclose
Need to stop i considering what remote control actually is it's a
we should remember that remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using
when the users using a remote control hear she expects the buttons to be in certain places so in some
on the left to we've got it's an engineering based design for a remote control so it's
but as a lot of features that are missing from that remote control so we've got to
weapons you have like you have numbers new remote control you
The remote their own remote controls
I suspect a remote control does think about it

how do we have to go about designing a new television remote control
So i had a look on the web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls in the analysing

This is our functional design meeting
It's all the functional design objectives we need
i'm gonna talk about the technical functions design of the remote control

critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy into data which then
the chip which is also controlled by the user so you have
so you have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip or
so you have your energy source your user interfaces controlling the chip that should also use
and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared

device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message to
personally what i want from a remote control is a device that simple it

focusing on the designers people specifically said that it's not remotes were ugly seventy five

more importantly though eighty percent of that they would be willing to pay more for a fee and see you're looking remote i
that being people frustrated with losing their remotes
you or are so frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and that ties
or people are only using ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote

we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled That extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function
is are working design presentation i have a pet
what we're trying to do is working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
working sanders figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function what
it's the parts of the working design they need to be figured out and
so in there we have technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements least

and record the frequency that they use particular buttons and the relevant the polls buttons hired
but within that there is also the investment should use novel idea is a buttons
control so it's one has got lots of buttons it's
or at maybe some buttons could be yellow but we can play
lots of buttons and that might be older people but then we've

so was gonna have the money to buy the parts that or
button them i'm gonna buy a new remote
Someone's looking to buy a new remote all they want like an upgrade now

sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls

in a way out suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different at the types of user interface is for this product
also in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities a device
the user interface is critical here because
a lot we need a chip that works with the user interface that isn't too complicated
i i'm the industrial design if you're components concept user interface the
user interface the user interface concept market trend were watching

it converts electrical energy to granting the beans and then
and they are designed to like this you have your energy source
you have your energy source rate there which
and personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people
energy source people don't wanna be changing it a lot we need

so i a couple time of tape ten people do not like that
looking and they need people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people are only
so that we not it's completely shocking people but
after thirty five people don't really care that's why it's so it's like
It's for like he ultimately lazy people you can't even
it's going to appeal to people maybe people who have problems with technology people who get scared by having lots of buttons and that
is something that definitely appeals to younger people
about like contrary to what people losing it too if it's the it's a fun place

And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume people are
people are so is that like change the channel but that sixty five percent terrain and our views so we really
the television saying change channel change the volume
it's just got it's essential functions of the tv changing the channel play stop volume it would be a lot
it's got big buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the volume changing the channel it does everything

for me to sit at a drastic difference between those two remotes
frozen he can show me to pick their we're
remotes one that has the easy one the one that has More complicated
you can't even be bothered to pick up the remote

that no shared a quite a bit rate anyone wants to work
because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
then the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task a step really so
because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design So the
will work or infrared bulb which will then bring
we decide you worked hard repairs you in

to age so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition whereas the
whereas the older people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition
that that older people didn't really care for voice recognition the

how we can improve on that designs that sounds and
so the chip that he in this designing it's gonna be crucial
why we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design
It's yes pretty it's pretty high-tech

also just the number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna
to do is there it's got for the backwards up down channel numbers volume freeze frame it's
Space is similar to a very basic weapons
you and you type in the page number you want to say like
and you just type numbers to get a different ideas and it gives
Lottery numbers and sports colours
i wanna be given any other numbers working on in terms of age later but
maybe by get more numbers but you before the next meeting in terms of users but this doesn't

and they watched watch tv and record
But if you're see the tv saying i go to page one sixty on c fax now that's what they're talking to
a crap remote taking with their tv that's
with their tv that's just impossible to use or maybe broke
like some tvs they have a a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
Like a button on the tv you can press the middle ring or

So the components that we find here are the energy source the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver do you
which then brings energy or information to the chip which
we have to be careful that doesn't impede it the chip transmitting information but

also be did some questions on voice recognition and found that
and found that the desire for voice recognition was inverse be related to age so
The only breaks i was given in terms of each was the voice activation and
that old specific for speech recognition are we gonna
which i feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control like it might be necessary

as you mentioned things like voice recognition but at the price a

so in some sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design

And we wind One large buttons for the essential things
Large accessible buttons with essentials

team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted To port it's practical function then
that which includes an emphasis on making the infrared very functional so
We want a possibility to to get a The possibility to it's the extra functions

certain frustrations that that we could try to take into consideration and with Our design that being
It's really know any frustrations are any issues that come up in your e in new or a summary

so we've got to find out find a way of striking a balance between the two
So maybe it's more useful to just find objectives like fashions and possibly tend to find specific target group as far as a just because

so then i will talk about a general object it's an have your three
talk about the new project requirements that just received and
source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied when they last i

much more infrequently in power which complicate what's going on
that hides all the complicated buttons so if

it's a device that allows us to do certain effects on the television so
it sends a message to the television saying
imagine just it is an electronic device

disadvantages you can't use it say to freeze the television but
lazy i don't wanna walk across the green just to adjust my television also want something that
control in this index opinions on the television screen just and some text things and they looking graphics on it and you just
or like your question earlier on whether this is going to be to for television dv or in it that are just a television that or focused on otherwise
Is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or
so if you wanna do something complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen down and there's all the
like why did you have to use a button on the television and the power

what can we do with the current state of technology as it is the second is
that's probably a population of quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway so
a what else you could put a number to make it technologically the end of select other than
why are we aiming for a technological advancement everything were
and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology we could use
they might be overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology

grew in a group and what are we gonna go cobble
we need to talk about our functions and our target group we decide
So our target group were saying fifteen to thirty five
of that especially that's wanted something so that they then can sub-divide and each group that means that is very few we need to each group so
We we don't have a deadline the target group at the demographic to be think we could

economic we need to find a balance between features and price
features and price as you mentioned things
of buttons it's fully featured everything
or Or not it and that But not as prominent as the main features

the idea of an lcd screen was brought out although they didn't have
we need a clear idea of exactly what this product as a
it's so it's like fifteen to thirty five but that's a good idea i wanna be given any

So the findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d information is projected to the receiver and
which will then bring the data to the receiver so hopefully that makes
data in do it from like an earlier project so

or fifty percent of the people mention that was the biggest frustration and you or are
go for fifty percent of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest one and

and finally it is more marketing our corporate image has to be recognisable so
you in your analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences
Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying a

receiver and in my opinion infrared is the best way to do that
and we need a reliable and clear infrared signal so

different ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on tv next and share prices and

so we really need to focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel settings because they're used
make that something make an audio setting is then given it much important and visibility on the remote as a minute channel changing that to use a lot more often and
and in order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like that
these settings adjust brightness

was that in this meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes
have to worry about four minutes left to define our functions so let's do
after the meeting we're gonna each complex a questionnaire and summers summary no

Repetitive strain injury
it's move on to the next presentation on the facts so
The battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering
Battery to read a long life battery
think it does i don't think about way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without that one but you

lot of we've got price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce it and i wonder
it and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise

image like it's yellow colour we've we put fashion in electronics
it's we put the uh_huh Fashion in electronics so we can keep that in
if we're gonna say that function fashion we put the fashion in electronics and you automatically the younger group that's was gonna be attracted to this
Sit simplicity in fashion
that we have to keep in mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion and or usability it's just

what the end user is gonna want from this product
He's two examples probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum
one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grind it works because
and then you get coffee at the end that's and hot because of the combination
select other than just media but code how is it mean you can
to see that and if you like to get the instruction manual it comes at the end you just only when really going on or even that those things can go out and you're happy

straight-forward interface like he was saying simple not overwhelming it with information and we need
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't
but in that goes in with simple city in ease of use really

minutes i emailed them to you and also putting on
and also putting on them in the shared folder so
Doubleclick on it With the right with the left hand one
after that we have thirty minutes of individual work i'll make
i'll make but on the minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides if they want to do

found what they analyse people's desires and needs focusing on the
out although they didn't have any details on A people's problems of them out were so some
was the biggest one and half people's that happen to me

i real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred
they had a hundred subjects and the usability lab and
seventy five percent of the a hundred subjects know that and that they are

it's gonna be twenty five euro remember so
itself so it will probably be sold separately twenty five euro by itself

later but if that the on the quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
Switch the quality of the chair
The quality a quality of all the components really
the product appeals the cross the whiteboard range of ages we said

i if you as are able to get access to the report that was a minor on
will they have a short amount of time
but you could have it a little charging station like a mobile phone Or like a little cradle for your ipod
and as per last time you get specific in crap instructions from your personal coach emailed to you and
you and hopefully help next time you'll be able to access more of the website that

but that's why companies like apple have you might lot of progress
of the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points

it also mentioned something called rsi and i was
rsi and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what rsi it's because i don't
it can we narrow down to maybe Teenagers and families

it looks like a white or thereabouts draw

The tvc ready tidy right
c ready tidy right Let's see lucy
Let's see lucy ready to haiti
