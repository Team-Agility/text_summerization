Because we always lose our remote control .

The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television ,

What speciality other remote controls are having

and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market .

What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ?

my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black .

so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions ,

being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product

I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky

, what twenty five Euros , that's about , fifteen Pounds or so ?

So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things ,

So , it's go gonna have to be pretty damn trendy .

remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty .

or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily .

, making a profit of fifty million Euros .

But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For .

, if you could maybe come up with shapes and suggested shades or whatever ,

because people really li like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player , M_P_ three player like any electronic devices .

we're k having another meeting in half an hour

, maybe more like a P_D_A_ , just hand held ,

Shapes and colours and how to make it attractive .

And , other instructions will come from the personal coach .
