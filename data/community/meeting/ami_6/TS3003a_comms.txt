that's the least we have to get from a remote controls so we have to work together
does everybody so experiences with remote controls and the ordinary remote controls but also a little bit different ones like you can use for other No
And other functions for a remote control
My remote control tends to fall a lot

our project aim is as you can see a new remote control it has to be original

that we want to make a remote controls with small televisions inside and like that
And it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all
that if you can put different devices in one remote control That makes that all these years that's

Is our project documents folder there's some
project so the project documents

we got like a lot of remote controls one for the tv one for the v recorder one for the dvd player And it's

Real remote is not really the company we are but

through first functional is it design individual work meetings off to the

off to the functional design then the conceptual design and the detailed design
And industrial designer it is going to work on the working design components design and a bit of the look-and-feel design the

i will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder
then i'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder

As you can see me for a remote control a selling price is at twenty five euros our selling price a profit

we put a lot of effort in design then in the product itself and

And we've got our user interface designer It's also
the user interface designer is going to do that technical function design user interface concept user interface design And the marketing
It's a past time to our user interface designer

so we have to work together to reach our aims

Move along to the project finance

but on the corporate that information side there's that there was real remote instead of real reaction Real remote

it really funny because you control with on this page in the it is form of you can also select

but i if that's all exceed the production cost so that's

And the marketing expert has them a little bit of user requirement specification trend watching and project the product is evaluation So
so we have to focus on different users different cultures and different trends as

Our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half euros so that's also

it's easy to draw your findings and drawings on there
as you can see you all i had to draw animal to just to get a bit familiar with it
