we wanna decide it if we should go for universal specific remote control but i have new
men like to have control the remote so
so i'm they admit that they should just they would spend more money in a fancier remote control which is
They get i'm ready Betty often because they lost the remote control very often so
bad They they that they should have at the same importance and they're in the remote comes in the remote control
I i see anyway it could be an interesting to really some a smaller fraction of all these remote controls short
you should say like this that remote control Being one or beyond thing and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition because
so research in this topic i first of all the a couple things i would like to see in a remote and just to a look
and this remote control on the right here is one of the more extravagant but it's not
expensive they're a lot of expensive remote control that
this is not the multi get that's remote control where it's it's very simple there's only
because i'm not going to speak into the into the remote control so
the remote control so it could be so if you cindy minutes
we need to have a on a remote control which is fancy which is a

i would if i had my perfect remote controller but we decide the numbers are all on it because They're just in the way they
because what if people as see a remote see that see a remote control without numbers they were think it's very difficult to learn ready to go to the different be a baby teeth into it at each other
Two roles more easily that you text true through your remote control
do we need an extra internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t what should be a special to you gonna do it

any be any a time corporate to do with the remote control it you get lost
so they want has to restrict the remote control to tv only because of time mutations
v also so they should be something come on control you start and then you stop it's like we

you say we're focusing on tv but still like a universal remote in that as a replacement remote control or is this something for a reminder of televisions
difference Even if we have context we can't really produce remote controller can bring out menus on but our company's tvs it's just there are

control but i have new you we inputs for about that the peaks
it seems that the remote controls have been have remain the same for the last five ten years there is no
what what we were present this presentation that is what we want the remote control to actually do it and
it is instead of having a mortal which is to be trained and being a micro controller
i'm in a if i was using remote control to say to turn the volume up because i can't hear very i don't really want you'd run out what people are saying by talking one on one instead of pressing up on the remote control unit
the remote control unit this dialogue all those are not icon here and run actually fun it was being said so maybe speech

the the most remote controls are used by more than one person's
one person's And as you targeting single people you can maybe
my personal preference was that we can have a us are sitting there on the remote control
could we feed the targets in front of cost if we goes two ways cd on the remote control
So you mean do you mean we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but there are a fancy intends to intends to had to have rarely maybe then you are
so the remote as one bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of

requirements i'd give it a marketing report and
Actually this marketing report is to tv remote court
is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market or what so the remote

so apart from a speech we can have the scroll thing but the buttons not all
there and then there could be another scroll button scroll up and then they could be buttons

they the younger people are they are more interested they incorporating new technologies in the remote control
But most of the and most of the young people are two thirty to fifty years old are really interested in this technology
yes we should bring new technologies for young peoples and
it up the people that gonna wanna buy a very stylish a remote control what's new technology is the people are we gonna have what i was internet connection maybe or

What most of the people of thing that remote controls are oddly battery so i'm
I so that people are awarded about the rrs ieds which is if
So list people are what it about the shape of the remote control They are
so it may be interesting to think in a in both prototypes for right and left handed people
i people go through by as a remote control when they broke brought to hold and they want

and you have to find it with missus and they improvements we could do to the car and remote controls
because really people want to be l to find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
so if you have too many buttons it increases the difficulty of finding it when you want so
although i do also find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or whatever but maybe that
find out can we increases the price part of this right control otherwise we need

And finally the incorporation all far as cd or a speech recognition see stand in the remote control could also interested but
So most of the things that you're discussing about the speech recognition means
being said so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than that helps
Maybe if the remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech recognition if
And also to go to automatic speech recognition technology is the first
so we're done things a thirty speech recognition this is
the following we don't go for speech recognition technology that
and that and if you need definitely not keen on going to speech recognition to adjust and that can fit

so it would be a point to To find out a solution to any
point because actually having all that some of the remotes out there this is quite although our price if
we know we need to still talk about price point because of use a
so if we can have a high priced a remote control it would really be worth us on that would be worth implementing
Of increasing the unit price

all the functions that are controlled through the lcd screen except for the really
the scroll is much more useful if you have an lcd screen and this
you your but One possibility is to download programme information into the lcd screen so then
If you have a list of programmed an lcd screen you just scroll for that program rubber band to a channel

because most channels that you two digit numbers and you have to press a special button to enter to do and then the summer so
so this is something else on it is really gonna limiting the number of buttons
the number of buttons this is that operating our universal remote control or a meeting is
It it's really a may be worth thinking little evening number buttons as much as possible because really
also it in application and then shape of the buttons is important but also it the number of buttons so if you have too many
maybe one option is to have that will fit but then door that that you have hidden mice the time that contains the extra buttons like say the number buttons

to actually do it and the simplest thing the remote control does is it just change that change the channel now
the channel than a one i what i use a remote to change the channel i a very you really use the numbers on the pad or usually use
so then still actually saying i want say i want to go to channel thirty seven because i know this programmes on you
programmes on off and you what channels already what's on If you have a list
i that one of the really gonna use all things you can do it was with internet connectivity would be to have this program driven interface rather than the channel number so if we can have a high
you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers like an interactive program guy
and it's that you have a teletext seen signal that you can That you can that you can get through the channel

there is no Nor significant difference Between the them the first know control
it means like this remote here is it's very thin and long so instead of having you might have it a bit big are all with maybe
we'll have a bit of a simple a task in that we're only doing a television remote control
either task say you have like a little not a little gonna base unit they can also receive signals of wills the television where you can say change the lighting in the room
it can watch it into big courts and that cords out of stand-by then for a device to the receiver
of televisions that really makes a big difference

so the working design is so user interface
you have to work and user interface and that you have

even if it was within budget do speech reckon rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you
and on top of the could be a speech recognition technology does mean sitting on the remote still
and for wise limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system as a wide and really quite a microphone also to be sitting there on that Remote
the speech recognition if you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it then they can use

and then also the search for which the top rated the remote controls on ep means talk on which is a customer know written review side So
So it there's a pretty wide range of remote controls these days and
that scroll was actually pretty a pretty penny way of change the channel than a one
So if you think about is like mobile phones are you don't use you don't remember people's fun be you remember the name and you're fine and then so this would be pretty
that incision to use this new remote control shouldn't be very they have looked pretty hard because what
so he's pretty comfortable if you want to get this and on top of

we still we still working on this twenty five you're price point because
price point because of use a list of can't be done for twenty five you your but

so industrial designer should work was supposed to work on and so on the working design issues
and if you look at them a lot of the universal remotes out on the market no work working
no work working on television remote that was universal is that they have a lcd screens which
a natural that we have a product to really that work it does work
and so you have to work on the components concepts you have to

the most tv watchers so we should be careful
because if you think if you're watching tv you can have a lot of these background noise from a tv which might interfere with the
You might have some background noise in the tv which will make the speech recognition much
but you should be able to add deviated is a tv eights
to be because as what they're getting a tv we can use a tv screen as the screen to feed back to do some feedback informations about what we could have
unless we have some input some video input to the tv or we have control of the tv then we can actually display that like if we
like if we produce the tv is then we can put menus up there but otherwise
but otherwise we need to actually have some something sitting in between the video signal and and the tv to superimpose that is this menu so that's
and not that we have contacts with people and tv or ccd so what systems that exist in use
for the same reason that we cannot all the main formations on the tv that we can work with and grab information which is that there
shame because even with you i don't you could even get teletext information from the tv on to the remote control especially if we don't control the tv i we need to

groups or you could even have some buttons like on the sides and everything but
very simple there's only a few buttons but what each of those buttons does something different in a different context so
And do more saying before but having different size buttons for different frequently used costs also it

so my feeling is that it's Rick regarding costs digits we have and target price it's not possible to goals two lcd
because the cost of lcd thing would be as high as the tv to that is very important

is and on top of that if we are having next functionality that are willing to show that twenty five euros money which we're thinking Otherwise
I'm that you can say that a speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros eddie hattie we just put it like
For twenty five euro i it's impossible but
and it would be good to know if there's any leverage in that any leeway in that town that twenty five euro because
twenty five euro because for twenty five euro we can really do with that but the very basic remote control and that seems to be
But then we should move to another does it because i twenty five dollars it's
Means that the idea was just twenty five euros is

cd screen except for the really main functions which have a couple of the round buttons
d screens which helps when you using multiple devices i suppose because you can have multiple functions different functions on the screen at different times
But there's one problem means then the user has to understand each of that functionality Because the same
but definitely you need to keep the buttons down to a minimum but not quite that interfere with the functionality of the device

so let's keep in mind about doesn't that this last point about lcd and speech record
that that would be fairly cheap thing compared to also use going to implement it
we were so what would be the goal of putting an lcd in our remote control
that this is the relation to know you would be cheaper than the lcd
Just see it's cheaper as compared of lcd

People so complain because they all have the same size of the voters four buttons which are not betty use like
means we can have depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different interfaces to speak buttons
to speak buttons out of something which is really everybody's the red so
the red so if you go to the market and you say that buttons that they're the people it is and on top
like the of people to use on line which a case of by speaking and doing this

I press a button to talk and the tvt v set on terms of
i you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying Ten volume up and you press the press the button like the of
They yes but the set ninety five percent

For the functional requirements and especially for the For the user requirements i'd give
we had the new requirements from the on the head of uses of the company and
not all buttons normal requirements like a big courting all those things are required and for wise

But the thing i find most interesting about this remote control and it's difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel on it which
so a scroll wheel is quite handy No
but also the scroll-wheel haven't mentioned here the scroll-wheel could
the scroll-wheel could be used without lcd screen just for changing channel numbers easily even
but we've seen before that there is a new way of tracking to choose a wheel

we view And that we decided to To go to individual actions for each of you so
use like for the more i zine time as or this Actions which are not very often bad
so maybe is a good time for me to to bring you to some new way you informations we had
but maybe that you can family removal time only have one would be good
so you have to store some time but on the On the chip itself and that
So you could have the name of the programme you could have a start time where it's up to
The time to start time all the programs you

user interface could be of two things one is the usual
one is the usual those buttons which there so that the user fee that's that he's smiling doing some he's going aboard the technology so he's
so anyway that is the first user interface could be off more than one type and
so one is that button interface which has not been shown because of lack of pain So we could not
put that so and all the la is that the court is sitting similarly there are different interfaces which could be there

And so i did a study with for incorporation of new technologies it seems that
You think that provenance of subsistence enough to target lot of such technology is is enough
it's more like means that the famous speech technology switch at existing so
It's a lot eighty patches that hour like that

and for them are our marketing expert should be for some specs
and the new users as our marketing expert was saying they can use the new bits mortgages speech recognition thing
have much idea but as a marketing expert presentation was

so this is the design should feed the hand shape so it
and right hand but i don't you think that the two points at fashion one thing you're saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be really small
still be in seoul extend past the hand
so means design should be similar to the traditional ones that would
wheel which is it's a really important design aspects

So going to have an meeting about the functional design
have so far as before starting i'm just going to to go for quickly to look through the minutes of previous meeting
so i really i would if i believe for a blind about what i what the prepared for this meeting
is ease up to you to go through these this way into to report be back next meeting so
discussion next meeting you have the task you have to work and and
we i hope that next meeting we do that we take some decisions that they record sex

of thing in the required reading names this particular sequence and then it gets activated
and as we have a also requirements to read to use to push from too the internet's maybe just something we can
have teletext but we want to get read one of four requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet so to
Because with the lcd you need more requirements you need that internet

got the master a very easy to use the mouse
you if you have the right of those are showing now how easy to use and how you can i never get to programme with that numbers and people might say that looks pretty easy
So this is the easy is assigned they could be sold
assigned they could be sold in inside the court or we can have things and
which is a which is easy to handle to scroll not too big

take to have the fonts special so you have man
so we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because you see the text is outdated now
and this brings us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet capability
And and also bring testing sings i have seen them on the one that's got a welcome pick it or is this we'll that we can use to navigate so

Maybe spanish name work especially if we're selling
especially if we're selling and the us market for the spanish thing is that
that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development but later

And the final mean you should be clear that the call for each units that means corals and logos of that our company should be key that you identified the park
one maybe one option since this is pressed to be kinda fashionable device is there's a certain factor that you can you can have with technology and maybe we wanna make

You could have a live in a little in each of the the main actors so you can't
So the question is to you open about this cd thing

and that's something you we may need to have as it is at least as an optional extra did gonna make our product since we say we put in the fashion in electronics
and that seems to be against the forces you had a company which is putting the fashion into electronics so i
into electronics so i would i'd like to know if there's any chance of increasingly
no but there other electronic program guides i bet they may not have
i bet they may not have pictures but maybe they the there's the penny

Although you don't wanna cut at that women out of the potential by is that there
which is if you to be this cda same movement which is not with our not very up repeat device You'll do we have problems were when you will get all
also selling the potential of the device in use
of the device in use a potentially you can then do a look like change the lights and i close the windows what about the heating on and

everybody's ready in good morning
So In my opinion there My and all these mine though shouldn't be bit smaller because there's more e
at existing so deeply the book would be which is the easiest so you have

but if you have any of the names that we could decide fall just to get something fun for our project we should we could discuss quickly Any ideas
so that's takes to mount the for the naming we see fault
the naming we see fault for the look-and-feel later so let's go for this representation
because there's more eds they're more like and they good idea is to it looks like a year
that scd e still on this get used to open to discussion is

so we could i imagine also that's the microphone it would be an ambiance and that and then it's microphones because i'm not
and all of them they would just do but according and put it in the map put it in the problem message warm and
message warm and then there's the chip which is sitting the green one and it can watch it into
but the average then quincy off by some bottom so it's a lot
audience is such preferences is very hot

Maybe something that sounds in english to send funny and spanish mind or
it also like in english it sounds like them and school you know men like to
