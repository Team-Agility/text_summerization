recognition it can take the function of a lot of a buttons
The the in the menu button does also does the function and then

But but the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push buttons
one integrated button is five times cost of a normal button
that it can do if it fits all the buttons in an interest integrated scroll push button that will
that it's made bald of buttons very clear this Maybe another
button the buttons integrates that
That is if you press a light on the plus button then you get No but

And we wanted the buttons in the special colour
the special colour of the buttons
i because we have to use a special colour anyway you forgot
Dropped the special colour and do the special colour for the buttons
Just put special colour for the buttons
make it a special colour know it looks fancy
that is only make it two special colours and that's the only have one button
The the button as a special colour the frame is a special colour
yes as a special colour for it so we can make it's a special
special colour we do have special colour
i read it is already a special colour so

Then you still need to additional buttons i believe for the volume
and lastly it can be a power button as soon as it powered on you
instead of an additional power button

You still have to have some button in the menu to go back
if you lose the back but it but let's say the only have to four arrows and the menu button
to the only need one button to move back Or
Or or on that each option you said you said and the screen thing but what sends back and you so like that on click can you go one step back and in the
step back and in the menu scroll click one step back so that then you

we have fixed and the menus on on lcd screen so
You have to search for them in the in this in a screen in a menu so

other option i saw was to drop the buttons one to nine so you can't directly access to channel that is tied use only the up and down arrows That would skip
That was exactly my point like let's drop all the buttons and just make one we're gonna
You could also dropped just three more all of these have a clue so much functionality you just right
and even if you drop three buttons from here we still have to make some adjustments round here so
we dropped supplies a one and a half but we still

Plastic with with the special colour we that
plastic with a special colour

we only need to the menu carol button the thing everything
then for the menu you can have a button that activates a menu
on you can go into your ear main menu you can choose
the possibilities are almost a limit is to build a menus in the
we should to build it so that if you don't push into the menu if when it's on
but as soon as you click it you go into the menu was also a priori doubleclick
and tree doubleclick for the menu

Integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton
or the integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton so that's
into we can do one integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton and then just
If we do what to integrate the scroll wheel push buttons we control all the pushbuttons
Or or do we just integrate and scroll wheel with the push button and then
and then if the moment you use a scroll-wheel the menu gets activated and then you can
so that then you need five buttons And one integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton
but it's just a scroll wheel which can push down so

so we still have the primary colours but only on the outside not on a button
The target of has a weak spot for the fact was like a colour it's funny shape and live
four months Current colour

everything and then you can make an overview of channels in the screen and select the channel clicker
of thing with the older we can do the channel the volume etcetera
if you have four buttons the channel up and down volume left right that
Can you change channels directly with just one button know
It automatically has the programme and the volume function but as
but how do you change from volume two channel

Control speech recognition
It's drop speech recognition
it's expensive but we never considered the possibilities of speech recognition
more popular i the screen was more popular then then the speech recognition have to look on the
known was wrong there are more people would like speech recognition then an lcd screen
we haven't really integrated this into speech into the system so
it's that the remote control make use of technology technological innovation like lcd screen a speech recognition all we
all we drop the speech recognition what it has at least one innovation
lcd is more usable and speech but

The remote control has the relevant or less used functions a receptive
the second point is it shows the relevant
it shows the relevant the most used functions power button
it's eos the relevant the most used functions
It shows the most used functions and they are relevant but
the remote control shows relevant the most used functions it's pretty
but it's useful to show something to them the small audience and then two

because if we lose the lcd screen But we need a lot of it's
screen it's that's about the same eighty one to ninety one percent and sixty to seventy six
a receptive screen settings
that it's the normal tv screen thing
and just put a pen into it and then it came on to my screen at the perfectly so
but the screen is useful in essence but it doesn't work

first of all i'll start with the costs because that's costing
because that's costing to influence our design if you don't
cost and also is good in a marketing have to forty five close people

the remote controls courting quickly real blah true or false and
the remote control i call a
But but ease of use was not very important when a remote you so that's
that's another question the remote control
the remote control this place corporate logo
But there's enough space for the corporate logo if there's only one thing
The remote control is easy to use or i would say
another question the remote control
the remote control durable if that's the
remote controls a good example for companies model you put the fashion in electronics

or spare special form
what a special for a special form

Do we keep the shade doubly curve together or do we go for single curved
i we'll have to go for single curve design the me
But we can keep it single curved with top use still curved but from this side it's flat on the screen
already we uncurved or flat the style of
it has to be curved and has to have that colour the screen
still we dropped also on the double curve
because it's an old one with a little curve on the side and in a different colour still
Plastic The single curved

Should reach to hints dynamo But that's
so the only option is in the hand dynamo
tire out there hasn't hand dynamo And then drop the colour you can
but i hand dynamo cost a lot of energy to keep the stream or things so i that isn't an option
hand dynamo do you want to mess

That would skip mind buttons and for half euros
so we still have tree and a half euro to use
you can choose this probably is then we have a half euro left So we can
It's it's a says four euros and it costs us to a half
And you can adjust relax and a half cup of coffee or right i don't
arrange that then you have a id what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own so

and then you can scroll susan option click on it goes into one feature click on it again
click on it again slacks features call it just it click again it's
to double click for volume and tree

the first points of the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user so that means
so that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions
Because the operating behaviour of the young use or source defined in colour and shape and the use of lcd right
so it's very true point it hides all was function to
requirement for the most used function and hides
then that's just a prayer of the young users also good thing so it will

That would say it's your point two euros compared to know
or false and the scale some points live it's
points live it's still feel though is

to this together is more expensive think of it's almost same as keeping this and they can draw
we can back to the drawing board and i
hold it can sit i sit there
that because that we couldn't hardly draw on the sit on the lower out of the screen we can make it big enough to actually draw it in there
also only the drawing and then the making of thing itself but also in explaining it to the other people by means of

It's a moment we have fifteen buttons on the lcd screen on a advanced chip on print we use
we need to chip for for the lc display
And out fonts chip on print
Do we really need that advanced chip for an lcd display
We about that sense chip we need for the display
The radar for ourselves with a display what it's a feature
No i don't think the current status of chips are pretty any chicken is taking

if you like if you are in the sound system there and a you wanna just a trouble this
Which you want The sound preview of how it's gonna sound right
so you wanna click on it activated way and when you move it here the difference of the trouble coming out so we're going into the sound so you need
you can choose flip channel you can choose sound options any options

It it's mainly got mainly cost writing on a lot of functions in this question so
It should have been two questions that realise that we can ask Sports like materials draft but the
all my it i all my it possible of pasta of questions so we can count it if you have
it if you have three first question is true versus kill
I don't because some questions are related to pass it if you send some too negative so
thing so it will cost of questions my my purpose but

there's a fancy look-and-feel we're using fruit or vegetable trays primary colours sports like material It should have been
easy to use this scroll is good fancy look-and-feel
fancy look-and-feel that's good Techno innovation

like this because it does not lose or identities the product or three
this and it combines the product evaluation
we evaluate the design with a seven point scale is falling the remote
i know the new design is which we know indoor it you designers
this year it's a specially use so i to evaluate designs and graph graphical

But that's easy because plastic is free
hard the sponge like and the three d shape that would give it something you have a friend
Definitely in casing we have a hard plastic
And the casing hard plastic also has forever

It's silly we should have at this meeting before we start drawing
And even the shape we have now a simulator them are and the refer start doesn't
It's funny start calculated
Where did we start which price twenty six

The only the only thing easy but it is that you don't have to move your fingers it is only one button
So easy personal form
are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue
i but there's one wasn't good because if i was drawn here i drew a line and that just came over here
And we move more to working together as a team because
as a team because at first you make your individual contribution and then come here and you can already what the others have to make it may have finally have

i have to make it an issue called find it was
the rno rr It's called the real
It's called the real remote right

what i see what is the a sample sensor sample speaker
so the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker and which can use the regular chip But which is six euros in total doesn't matter

But the board of the powerpoint in word and like that
So and about the board at such a dead stop and
with it and as i said i have no idea powerpoint works so we'll take me for date to be able to make a normal powerpoint presentation but once
the drawing board has to be integrated into powerpoint to can just easily
the problem with powerpoint for me is that you have to put in the pre made chunks as good as you can draw something

But if you have to power of for ten minutes i
about five minutes to the end of meeting and
i have still ten minutes to finish to report
As the after that five minutes you have ten minutes to finish it or Alright and we
Warning finish meeting now

you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten

We still have to fruit or vegetable print

i don't think see the persuaded management to say this is better for a market so you sell more that
so what we have last longer Because if in a way she is based on the initial user requirements alright
the criteria are based on the user requirements the tense from the marketing research and marketing strategy of the company itself
Techno innovation was good because a marketing requirement for

people like that so just do normal battery
the batteries does thingies last forever
At the lower that's the lotus court a
the lotus court a battery right
so if you give it rude to positive it actually means that the lower the better but if you give
You could copy paste the picture if you want

But that's still the same ideas kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things
and live was in that use kinetic energy is bones
it may have finally have some idea this is gonna this is what we gonna make together and i'll range this and you arrange that then

it's the pen is more intuitive we're all used to writing with it and

check with the excel sheet
you could check if the excel sheet
i have to make an report of every decision we made so far And i try to catch
And i try to catch it just for i received the excel sheet so i

they're in a word document which i will open
prototype presentation interrupt so
interrupt so the finance that we have redesigned
write this and i if you have to present because i didn't receive any information that's for
celebrate you can just if you make finish my presentation
The presentation is still open so i finish that

It's a put a purple hair That's trendy

So if i understood it right we have to count these numbers
in the day since they're all one digit numbers right and then you can
I i surely this number actually tells I don't because
but But if you don't take that into account there's plenty of room for creativity also

Excuse visual feedback so

What time do we have to deliver you port for
So how wire that project process ago that you we're
that you we're pleased with the process first poster are

doesn't respond all sorts of the undo it
The the this stories this size are useful to discuss things so
