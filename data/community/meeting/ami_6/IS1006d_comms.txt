And the buttons are not colour eyes

And making someone on the list of different fruits we she's able to for all to make colours and able to my smile for it next slide
in the controller many different colours are different fruits and

you can use a base my remote control or
remote control or are you can use be some nicknamed your remote control like ball we're going And then if
from one to seven and then we're just going to have an average which we give us these bad you of our remote control so
so the question is do you have that than minimum requirement of a remote control so i don't
things even if you lose one you can use pork what or in the controller many
so you feel a key something a protection for the remote control
we have at their remote controls to create

and if you want to make just twenty five you push buttons it's
that's for didn't use one arm the to the television on button you have to
buttons the buttons soft and that's
buttons are all standard buttons it's only buttons

And you can choose colours on your day for eats d or even many colours
but nobody's Being tuesday colour
also colour it seems that we have the role colours for the lcd and
and it's not very clear what is the colour of this dish the case is a
Special colour or it's funny and

and so buttons and using lcd or like you can use these in stock real and select each other option one that cd and then you on and off then

So what size is because the lcd s not that does control touch screen you cannot go to channel twenty five

like this they're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attacks control so

And we have some lcd controls like in a switch in the lcd display if you want to use that cd or you don't want you can use a normal button and we have
Yes unit cd display

titanium so we'll start with the lcd you can ask a ball
and you can deal on the lcd using these going to scrolling all the option so if you don't
functions here and other functions will be on the lcd so

and then some you will propose some great to you could criteria to evaluate this prototype Then
prototype and we now need all together to try to evaluate it to see if we make sense to do it if it for the fees our What are you wanted to and things like that so

As before going and you're creating in producing these It's from the reuse Remote control it's very percent of users say if it makes sense if we have a chance to set it so we need to be evaluated

it's most of those anymore the same As they are more than material we can select And it's protocol And associates for it's some of
You select trendy you select five that's it
seen lcd like you have blocks and you select which one

that's easy it is if you meet Even haitian criteria
one meeting that you it's it for sees the criteria whatever it is and seven meeting

you can use it now my switch channels as buttons so first i present
So it as we discussed we had to switch on switch off then only want and
or if you go to the side it's a channel up channel down and if you want

so that's simple basic mould
simple basic mould it easy but just two buttons and the jog dial the

that's see if it hits me the evaluation criteria
so no it has to fulfil the financial criteria

are the costs under twelve years
twelve years project evaluation

The jog dial for controlling the course or on the lcd screen like selector
screen like selector the menus
menu minus a tree

assuming know there's some research done in the field of produce a manager from mechanical engineering produce
engineering produce and it's just for mechanical energy
So that when you take the device and push the button you produce enough energy

It's the detailed design meeting so we're going
after this meeting will propose the party for our success for the

i it's it's not my fear of twelve bucks
Twelve bucks twelve
Twelve bucks twelve and a half

now it's technical specification but or Calling
even you can call in favour you colours for its they're doing on your more north

own gaze and then you can feel and simple Designs And you can choose

So for nets wasn't my daughter take it and then and throw it away do you think it makes sense
yes and then we have the sample speaker or sense are for speech recognition

then we can help always find mine is left
a remote speech recognition location finding You make a us in this this fancy style but it is then

And what about the strawberries and the top i'm not convinced
so maybe tv can have rub or from spongy's or strawberries and different colours so

We analysed all the fruits and contacted
Fruits betting spongy tight end up I
round it but still we got some rubber fruit here and it's completely

And location finder and we want to build
and we want to build the location using speech recogniser you can use a

With the flavour fifty median something first make a part
that and feel get twelve fifty

Is it that the detective size and weight that is
and weight that is it the real sized for

know it's is it the scroll wheel and the pushbutton the centre one or only
you go on the location we easier a scroll wheel and then

and we have speech recogniser here you have microphone
here you have microphone and then repeat reports or ones and then they'd recognise and

So first mark and drama are going to present the prototype and then
leave again or maybe that the prototype That's julianne

so you can press these modems to increase or decrease the volume
it's i had these is volume control and ten a genius these are the main
unique to like press two and firing

So you see we can be one for a cost They propose that's like celebration us and we've got

So we want to have a simple and perfect shapes the case and this phones you can have your
It's a single gene simple chip
so about shapes advanced chip-on-print

And at the end we were that we then evaluate ourself as a team And
Teamwork very strong as a team work no
team work no problem

a word and just have to remind you that you so this is much less important than fanciness whether it's fancy and that
and that's it went very important point where on time

so first i present us we can't as perfect model and then

so we need to be evaluated and tried to do it in account stuck if we need as much as we can
it's pay the accounting as we would prefer
we would prefer maximum is like some remove

more or it powers it covers all the angles even if it
so it sounds like a hand dynamo about real high tech for it
we can put it that hand dynamo on a battery powered i

I suggested threes Because everybody's

And one is no it's really glad to obtain and It's such a recession device so

we have some regions strange a regions

Whiteboard digital pens
white board is useful digital

and it's completely completely secure to leave it was children

if you can say is that sends the stars showings that way And Society will accept that's for

I i which is the russian trick to erase anything

when we see the results there's no adults that Maybe a lack
Maybe a lack of leadership Teamwork very
