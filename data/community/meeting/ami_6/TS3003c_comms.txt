of interest because this would be db s would that be the innovativeness in the remote control
you could imagine that the remote control be standing up straight in the king station
and you can think about or when you lost your remote control you can do call it to give is that and i was sick single so
almost Remote control so using a on off button on the place
should be advance because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control And that's it
and i don't think they like remote just laying everywhere in their rooms so
you have to just to make one standard remote control and
remote control and you can sell a few
give your grandfather in new case was remote control or whatever
Country make a condom a good remote which you can flip over in use On the same
in the remote so check out the corporate website maybe The

Buying an objective of a two control the remote control the I found some something about speech recognition so maybe
we also As if they would if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control we can
so the elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time

line of doing this means functions which are not featured another remote controls
the batteries you could insert the find the most remote control function in there

after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts are going to
this leads us to some personal preferences the remote control
the general like most all the remote or flat just straight And
so the remote control is to play in your hand so it's

the place so people will recognise And the buttons are
But you have extra buttons so people can

the remote control and the docking station should blend in the In the room
the docking station and small
but if we've choose for that option the docking station would can become obsolete so
And besides that you mention it would make the docking station obsolete And
And our docking station could be one of the e marketing issues with which we can
so maybe a docking station them the remote a place
but it's a more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station so you have
energy but just a simple battery which you can read a little docking station is just as good a much cheaper
And the cover of the docking station is also

you said you wanna put the Changing channels button on the right side see you can see
But if we would make it changing channels and changing volume button on both sides that would certainly You great options for the design of the remote
And to put and A buttons for Changing it channel welfare

in a watch which you just shake and it produces energy but
you shake your remote and then it powers up
actually i don't think that older people like to shake their remote control the fresh he's use it

Most important thing is the fancy design
Innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design line of doing
So now for the next meeting we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design that's important
design that's important the corporate design image is going to be in the remote so

i was thinking about the special button for a subtitles just
just one button to keep it a simple i want push
simple i want push on the button you get small subtitles
double question push doubleclick it so you get the excess subtitles for people which can of walk and we small us apart so
so you have a button on your docking station which you can push and then it starts beeping

That it now we should have any problems with Choosing channel
we should start by choosing a case because that's the

and the overall design we have to discuss about so form of it so
for the case the supplement and the buttons it really depends on the designer and the chips that
so it's do it just up to the design department what we're gonna use doesn't really matter for the
our project and Make a good design for all the grandfathers in grandmothers it's fair

requirements are teletext docking station audio signal small screen that's a as an a button information and we're
the docking station and small screen would be are main points of interest because

older people so they would prefer design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station So it would
And i prefer the corners to be round

It's possible to you to make it quite cheap system for speech recognition and
And then we can still use the voice recognition but maybe then for only the channels
I'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price
And the voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use
maybe we have to discard the voice recognition Because
if we don't have voice recognition And that will avoid use a lot of energy to use

only buttons for sounds for a mouse shifting a per cent can and channel or that shifting around
and for shifting percent i like it and channel or for putting it out sounds you can just give a sign say sound off our
but the buttons we have to use the on off sound higher or lower the numbers zero to nine and that buttons and more again but one button for shifting of chasing down the channels
and special button for shifting up and shifting down channel so one place the palm of the
order for functions for subtitle one button on for sound to
Is it possible to program it so you got on the left side a little on the right site buttons for shifting or up and shifting up and on the or that that What are the site buttons for shifting for the sound or

for the boat buttons we can use plastic or rubber and the
we would have to make one with the control which would fit in with a wooden cover and Plastic cover it more original one the standard one
On which you can apply the remote control on which you can apply different case covers
but you would have to be fancy with either the would cover or the plastic one
So everybody's with changing covers

this is this image will give you Little bit of an impression about the look and feel That the remote should have
that's the As a pretty big influence or production price and image So
so if they would increase the price for which we're selling their remote control
Because it will increase costs assignation and significantly and i don't think

it should be advance because we're using an lcd screen
and on top of that the lcd screen would held in making the remote control easier to use
Here's the deal lcd screen
because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in so the elderly
and at the same time look easily get screen because it's a bit

these are some more group specific findings the older people
the older people prefer dark colours they like recognisable
this is in you shake to older people so

And also what you said You can ages of four is recognition by finding back your remote but
an hour earlier market research we should allow
So that brings us back to the energy if we
which brings is a did it back to market thing as if

for the energy source we can use the basic battery or
for options we could use the basic normal battery a
small this place at least it will one on one battery for a six months or more so
just Choose for the battery That brings us to

or at as an optional thing that kinetic energy like in a watch which
fff first of all we have to see it it is possible to in to use kinetic energy bridges think
is very light so it's not a very good option or the kinetic
good option or the kinetic energy
in that case we could use kinetic energy but

the television for the side of put the sound of

channels also we want to use a little d display for for displaying the the functions of the buttons
display of it it's a just a small display So
But it's this reach years about bit a large lcd should display or just a small one a be want to use
choice there because we're using the gd display so it's

just you have just to focus on the primary functions So
in that doesn't really fit the image unless we would start to product lines For should follow function
For should follow function of role
doesn't really matter for the price for the functionality

for the casing d and affection department can deliver a flat casing single or double curved casing it's
right our industrial designer talk about flat single and double curved Could you
And rr to manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double course a curved cases
And would single curved and double curved mean

besides that we would advise to bring two editions one with a woodlike colour and maybe feel and one with a grey black colour you would like for them or
and grey black colour for the People the less means
if wanna choose for wood or the black and grey or both
and then you can make an was colour black and grey all the colours as

this was for like an lcd screen like you would have on the most advanced mobile phones

the kinetic energy sources rubber fancy but
First we can talk about the energy source since that's the

they like recognisable shapes And familiar material
it trendwatchers i consulted advise that it should be the remote control on the docking station should be telephone shape so you could imagine that
So it would be kinda more telephone shape
It's a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape
so you suggest we should design two different telephones

that's a one encounter any problems during the preparation
maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and right side
For left handed users also
but isn't the problem that left and the person's Use a different hand the functions

we thought also maybe if you figured something else or an file something else does that mean maybe you can now work
some research about the designing a fly interface so
so the interface What type of interface do we want to use
The user interface design it's the same story and
so the industrial design and user interface designer are going to work together on this one But

for are group we're focusing on the people of sixty eighty years old this is These factors are slightly more equal
you would like for them or exclusive people are more money and
but it will attract Elderly people wanna have something exclusive Which they

this is the second phase we're going to discuss today that's the conceptual
that's the conceptual design meeting And
And a few points of interest In this meeting are the conceptual specification of components conceptual specification of design and also trendwatching

the research indicated that was by far the most important factor
about half of half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use for
So this would be very important that we at least include these features
and most important factor there is the wooden colour so didn't actually

So that brings us to the discussion about their concepts
Then We've got a general idea of the concepts in the materials we're going to use So now for the

Our surveys have indicated that especially wood is Be material for all the people this
And as the trend watch a year Presentation showed it people like wood but it raised the price
wood is a lot more expensive to produce

these are all for me that Point you addressed and your prayers presentations you're going to
these are the points we on new requirements and the target market requirements
the summary have any comments on these requirements that were really know
very good point i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes rsi so that would be

we going to target those sixty to two eight year olds customers
it's a like a speak speech recognition and special button for selecting a set that's just a three year

the side so it's run a normal the single

but a mobile phones so like the nokia mobile phones when you can't change the case of it so
because like on your mobile phone it's always a ball

that's first I'll show you the agenda a first opening
And we can build in a function of which shows the channel or some which the television is on so
you don't wanna swing before you can watch television the solar cells

i personally think the lcd screen you wanna use with the extra information nobody as anything against it was just
was just some extra information is easy
information is easy to ignore as so if you don't wanna use

and inform you buy the trendwatching and then over the past few days
And Besides that i deployed some trendwatchers to milan and paris to get all the news trends and i've consulted
and i've consulted some additional trendwatch trendwatchers after the original trendwatchers should turn about what the The best design would be
turn it like this and then Flip it upside down

There's a third meeting already I hope you enjoy
I hope you enjoy challenge i
just a three year mentions the last meeting

and then we're closing we have forty minutes
it's a doesn't Imply any technical restrictions
maybe should just start on a blank page
And then i will start in thirty minutes again

we distribute it some more on cats questionnaires And
ask a supplement we could to of that later a rubber belt like and i slipped
But you're going to get your instructions send the body coach

you or better should prevent Repetitive strain injury bit

you can save this one and Folder script
