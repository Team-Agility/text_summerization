And we'll have to decide on the remote control concepts and
the second concept is a fancy control so we're
It it is an interesting concept to see the however voice control

but suppose you got a cold you have a mute remote control
remote control so maybe you can keep it for would be you're not obliged
That is changing how the remote control is gonna be bit because then you
if you see the pushbutton control it you can send these can use remote control ever and the were the same one if you have the language
but so you need to come out and a microphone sitting there is a remote control
Which controller would you prefer to use you as a remote control user
but you need new remote control and then because if you wanna browse internet or i if you wanna type something or
so i if we can have a remote control that is really basic simple then works fine it's already know
control or A plastic remote control like this one so and
it's an added value to the remote control and maybe
that where the three first points from the remote control and then use No if we look
and so the colour of the the society will be really It will be seen in the remote control so you will have

my mail and the first is the logo control
the channel control and just a would be controller fancy controller
Maybe tried to makes the go controller and the fancy control
Just want to have something comes along which is an a intelligent control easy to use sophisticated and fancy
So maybe we're just focus on the go control or less the fancy control maybe try to mix

i know it's more interesting to develop a remote control always speech and gesturing whatever but you have to think

And To Have a better overview of what is the fashion in general i have checked more than only the remote control market so next
even if it's in general fashion we want it to be in the remote control
And remember as i said last meeting we are really have to be able to fashion remote control and

we want to we want power control to be smart So maybe you

So but find out if it is somewhere in the room if you may be feeding in the table is there you go to say it's triangle one and this is the remote control it gives order to the tvc for
we you we'd be a wooden wouldn't be wooden remote control or
And try to find maybe a shape for the wooden remote control

so we need to have caught some corporation these some research things to do with a speech recognition and on just recognition or
Of all in the immediate what can be very speech recognition is more reliable under false the immediate vocabulary just recognition is also worry
I don't see how i doing speech or just to recognition would make the remote control look more like go
the user is not only interested in having speech or just recognition know
so maybe related to what you said was the speech recognition as

Technology such as speech recognition technology and just recognition technology so we
because that this technology is the for the immediate were really need to the mexican recognition is very
a second point is this d wanted it to be technologically innovative so maybe sort
the remote control has to be technologically innovative it's three then

so we're but keep the cost some of the impression that's all control is very attractive
we've is a lost the features we can attract a lot of user

maybe can have a switching more apart from voice control or two
but what is the use of voice or just recognition if you have a remote control that like have an object if you
if you want to use voice suggest you need to be free without any objects you just want to interacts
that switching from one country cut corners it'd be a problem so they

because for the intelligent contra you said that we can use the voice recognition are they just recognition that's
but how is high risk easy to trust like speak recognition all just a recognition
Be recognition system will be able to instead of french if you want
And what about for voice recognition do we have microphones and where will be they
is it do you think it should be only voice recognition then just recognition wall
but you we used to send you mobile out of you choose the line b s was recognition that's the
Because that would be voice and just recognition there's still some Disadvantages for this

As the same time it's important that it's easy to use
it's three then easy to use it's not so important actually with respect to the other ones so

first i will present the concept of user interface
there's three concepts and the user interface the first line
and what about the user interface concept

fast as these there's several examples tv s
so you can build a black box and put it on tv
tv you can retrieve that tv we then you tv be seen that probably function but
No it's not the only the probably only the user of compromise that is also the use of the tv
Edt into cvd tv
and support you i'm what do we get into that you if you have of what voice control why not to put it back on the tvs speed add to the tv and you don't need a remote control activity so
That it should be image on the tv and not on the remote controller so

Would you would you agree if you all controller read that cover only a single function if you do not have some function i did that
that we can add for a lot of some function like for browsing can go into that so like that but the
you that the file that's not the function of the controller that the functional
that the functional tv you can retrieve

that's as team Expert told us most of the people want to use the remote control to zap between channels you think that will be able
or if you say channel three two three four six light they will be born after a while you don't
the programme so this a channel four channel three channel for some of the all the size is
it would be they're not to tune into the channel control and just

meeting user really we want a fancy look-and-feel then also
And then if we take the or doing all the ranking all for the points fancy look-and-feel has on the score of seven would have six as important
so we see fancy looking look-and-feel is the most important one and then if we combine
So you will have to work on be look-and-feel design to have the easy to use board for an fancy remote control with some added value such as the simple vocal commands recognition

the key it a lot of the key feature a file control and that he's it has some but that keychain
with a then it necessary to design you comparable or without any breaks are in features
But that doesn't doesn't not in a small tv simple them to read they're all comparable we've anyway if there's no key features and then you come from that's the thing

but suppose you have a family watching tv and if we want to use their private remote control in the same time do you think it will work everybody wanting to change channels in the same time
if you have the language you have to be harder for each time
but we want something of that words all the time every day every how more for everyone
and you will have next time to show was modelling at the play-doh remote control so you want to

And with no increase in the private production price of the remote control
we have to take care of the twelve euros
i'm it's the user pay the same price he's happy to have recognition but
it should fit on the price you want out of four euros

so i want the comparable to be easy to use that to be said fifty functions so it's a combination
so it's a combination of easy to use and the fifty functions

it's hard it is easy vote to remember
is easy vote to remember it i reckon i did
control we need something that's easy international suppose
As the other thing i want to discuss it so easy which an impression a piece and in addition we want to have so really
not very complex comments but easy common so

and they want to watch or their favourite sent to the programme so
buttons because it's i don't have any in the dark it's fish and
so if you want to watch tv in the darkness so
tv in the darkness so if you want to fine you're fine your remote control of these are lost in the dark and it's

You got the this product it is technology has already been developed so
reliable but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products
if you if you alright if you are you have a product is works matter percent reliable we do replace it with another man
but you have to think the user uses the one who gonna buy the product and

Take a set gesture of a power
and put it on tv and just to recognise gestures and voice
That's up to the prom see uses the voice of the gesture so what can happen if you if we
but you need is receiver to record a gestures and double as

or you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this them and it can be something interesting to make people buy i
And maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people or is that interested and

I i will let's our user interface designer speak first is to take heed jordan
Technical as the sun interface
do you say you have the user interface would be very cute very
sometime it's very coming is to use voice interface and just interface then use button but

So let's start our second meeting conceptual design So
is because if they do all the time the same gesture as you said previously in the last meeting maybe you will get injuries because that's or if you
we have only Of our five minutes left Spends for
just to meet the user requirements i'm just who's sort and then the use of the remote control market And
So again it's similar to what i've said in the previous meeting
So the next meeting will start in thirty meeting minutes so

that's the other one teed off and kind income for a dv
income for a dv you if you have the control save ten three so we've

no this is the three concept of a rubber stopper
So we have said decisions about the components concept about the energy So

and the other point i haven't mentioned these people want to have a spongy touch
you will have to work more power on the spongy way to add spongy and touch to the buttons And

button but that way if you look at not funny all can i just speak something that yes why is true
recognition wall you still have the possibility to use buttons
where as a boat and that is the buttons are a light at the end of the night or you can
the buttons i prefer as a as cd collected buttons because
like the one you've jordan david was all the buttons and you it sounds good technically but

innovative and maybe using solar energy with battery would be something interesting maybe would
And it can be credited to energy solar energy source for the marketing aspect and saying
maybe try to mix them is to concerts together just in one Do the remote control with solar energy and batteries and the low level cheap send would
more of these supplements the Solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add
And white casing a supplement to

And that's that we price of adding these solar battery would it be something really that will increase the price of prediction more
if we want to have a battery a regular battery and the sun our initial battery it could be you can add it in because the price but it to

we cannot rely my hand or percent on these features to you to use the comp are but it's the
are but it's the features of our corporate site as you have the feature of voice recognition mean mobile but you still don't use it to be a mother out but you we used
that's the features not flat or percent reliable but

the last line to hide income for so there are three concepts

What what we really see this year is that every scene from clothes shoes and furniture is easy inspired by fruits and vegetables
We go to the fruits and but it vegetables and the other point
that was the main point from the trend And fashion
not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends

even if we did not want that you would but just a part of the maybe wood and in wood and it's
so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wood and design
Or we could maybe have balls like out of wood and some rubber for the buttons all

and then if we combine this with the fashion from new and then paris

No we just have some call three series some research and cd we don't
and cd we don't have to do some basic research on this field
so in some country where you live in the countryside you are far from the cds in some place and instantly are so if you have it at least if you have solar a limitation you just when you want to have a recharger or a remote control or you just put it on the side and after one or you can come
and maybe can attract will be a call to call it customers And that's
uids for cd is some keys like swedish and as one two three four

it's true if you sell this comparably friends you can recognise strange
and you just the matter for eighteen bad eating comparable
it's big mystery risky
Stick to the first part so what's the difference between our comparable with other products in the market that looks
but there's no big difference between that and it's a comparable

it was to design used to show use the design of what the inside at what the inside and out as a different component of sir
so it would be interesting so i could show you some picture of what the inside and

chip on print so you if you propose lot of all chips would be a and off to have something working
so you will have bob and david jordan you'll have to work together on the prototype for it and you will have
And so that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach

if it if we if they you when you sell this car for you try that is can check that handy if it's true if you

saw the last point is you were so we do want to have some very cheap Integrated circuits chips or do we have to lower level or very expensive depends but
What about the touch screen for them and it's expensive
the touch screen We'll be as expensive as the lcd but and so but

of war because you don't have to wear a microphone and

and find maybe we will close the position So
questions we can close the session

be interesting after you some tuition to have on that bus presentation

is from you can't keep a real slice the president
