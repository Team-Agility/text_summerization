you're right click i was thinking it's left and design right-handers in the family want to have two remotes

the main we'd have to make I'm right handed one and i left and this one
Imagine it did it with your left hand i don't think

actually trying to find ideas for ideal remote

and it's also can for mobile to the size of your hand i
to the size of your hand if it's too big it's a rubber remote so you can

and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria And the criteria
so i'll just write criteria we'll get What Second criteria
criteria sex rsi is a good i

separated from the other remotes got on the market so
that that it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes are actually to give you press the strain injury a one that's a complete opposite so that's

it would be compatible with the left and right hand side

funny all design the meetings could be this quick

Like the amount buttons people like a lot let black So it's a one

very simple and easy to use double

it's i see are more so it is we bring fashion that's it to electronics outside i could be quite fashionable
and feel so it does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about as it is it

if we build rocket ships we can handle that can do that right that remotes

there are designer there are some heated discussion but we
Poker we design and no more believers But
design to put that we've met we've got a prototype is within budget

no i know people who have left handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer for the first family and to have a mouse and everybody's using right-handed knows
Because it is more k to lie and the table left-handed people but

this is fine a small and then they say it's something that's new looks a bit kirk if people want that it's

we wanna do we want it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber very simple and easy
not made of wood or titanium rubber it just simple

That was the main criteria from the last meeting you had to teach you proof

Plus red which is a fruit and vegetable
actually in wanna manager of this is that after the after this fat of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be remote we're not

that they get lost is easy to get lost
The mobiles get lost all the time

And for electronics we decided on it being just a simple the easiest Saying this inside and
not every everything else is fairly simple but the fact that we use the kinetic energy was new

So If you hold it like that the one on your thumb the thumb button is the power button

has a on a banana them as a mute button
banana them as a mute button and

using the pens and writing on these special pads and all that

So at this stage this is the last meeting of the project we don't have another
No when it's meetings finished but officially then we'll get a questionnaire to fill in a Or or six

But we have a vested interest in there Profit profit sharing
Profit profit sharing

that this is we saved on the production cost do we know how much we were making a profit

then they have special colours on line
Special form they're special form they're in shapes and

and then you can also there's a numeric keypad on top so you can keep directly to the channel if you want so
In the corporate that's next to the corporate simple on the top floor that with that we will just go in that existed

Hold on folks We fit

it's got them the black yellow and blue

i'm not a put it in one of my email side percent of

Index finger is channel up know fingers channel down ring fingers
ring fingers volume up you think he's volume down

and i might just wanna put in as project manager The the price for everybody here i haven't worked on it both individually

The case we've gone for the double curved

and everyone's come up with our individual ideas in there and different apartments and

The wind up and vibrating pen than

It makes watching tv healthy
and if i'm a good time with the tv you can start about your as far

it's not a speech read that will come up on the computer screen is a picture file rather than actual text

that's gonna cost ten euros seventy cents seen it to make an thought

It would be different if it was of handwriting recognition but it's not a speech
Right they do want to handwriting recognition a message the first step

Just that's read any of the ornaments and break them
Or you can buy delimiters but you won't break that

wee which we had it As far as our financial goals we have a specific number for profits that we wanted us fifty
us fifty know fifty million

I see that makes sense because i remember like You better off my mom over there i remember people's mom's making like a play doh where you just like make the you use colouring and then make some go

think where the envy of all the whole wall there are teams

so it's really basic functionality is as far as what keys are available but we think it's very
It has got as the corpus course gotten bass if you polls about

So all that important cues are ready you if you're right it convenient place for you to access them so you don't you

I it's probably better that we wrap it up and have five minutes of Sounds

it is it colourwise and is it spongy so what mark

It's not the thing that's gonna slip like between couch cushion

Lisa marie you just apply to that one
