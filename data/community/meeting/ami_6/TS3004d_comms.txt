we have decided so In the channel buttons there's a little colour on it
And this that and d so it can choose what colour colour you want how
Maybe one button to switch the colour of your that's
you can all that and then the colours that that multiple buttons
just make it three buttons all the colours on it just write
Colour buttons And then we choose

and the back light thing the thing that lights up we have
it's about or flashing lights and the background lights up for the phone from the buttons
or are they there are back lights on the slide panel two or and
buttons just a green light of the light
and the normal back lights up also not the buttons but behind the buttons so the

Just press it once the colour should switch to press again the colours which you can maybe

We also how many buttons are required or what buttons but
the on off button step buttons mute buttons are together and at the place to use we are used to find
the on off button is bit bigger so it stands out that way
you have the problem more often with rubber buttons
wood rubber buttons or
And then you need a button to call it to let the deep
Just old fashioned kind blackboard style button

No you have a different chip for speech recognition so
the speech functions buttons
So you're multiple speech buttons i how many
you don't have any anything on how many buttons speech you try to sell it counts redesign it
But the second part like speech that so that will be article or

and what that was what basic colours very at twelve twelve The basic colours

them here mute function and on off function text functions this the
playstation or or dvd player that function
or you can and late beneath and the other functions
just put it on us extra for extra functions
So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons will for what function
The speech function and the colour

the button supplements i didn't i'd i was wondering if this Special colour maybe was i'm not
it's A special colour you can skip
special colour you can skip this one because it's all quite normal you get different ones at

Scrolling the navigate the menu
else are menu buttons but arrows
within the mail a menu button

Slide no but it's quite use for a remote control
at least it's a lot better than current remote controls
it's not as fast as the usual remote control because
and maybe we could maybe noblest in a compare all fault fashion and remote controls so we have speech
That's not normal and to a normal remote controls as
only saw the telephone not an remote control
different forms for a remote control that's new to
So we made it in time made a remote control

scroll wheels on the left side it's
it's the standard place for scroll wheel as i know
some some text next to the scroll wheel that is volume
because the scroll wheel and it's very handy but the first time you get this thing in your hands is not to use the scroll-wheel i
use the scroll-wheel you must use seat for a turn up or down or i don't
so we have speech the scroll wheel and the slide you miss like that
And scroll wheel back lights five
new the scroll wheel and the slides
scroll wheel and the slides this like it's pretty new

but then you can switch back to normal that teletext you just switch it off and then
but if you're in a second stage the third stages to switch teletext off so you can
And and switch channel is there's a back light so

we just made a word file With the basic Elements
these are just basic functions so all the non basic
there's one function i use daily and it's not on the basic functions it's to
Here and Basic functions and selecting the device it's

colour of changeable and also transparent and
and colour and transparent or just transparent i

and or are we making a slightly opened like underneath or
so like underneath you can slide up and you cannot on the functions
You have a lot of room that you can slide or open
but because if you use the couple of years and some sometimes the numbers on the buttons are slide-away
It's pretty if you slide it open that It lights up that's
i already have a vcr and it's from ninety eighty eight and a lot of the slide it's a

it the material should be hard plastic
use hard plastic is that the allows us to use that would be buttons non rubber buttons
Just like your telephone hard plastic

name the main zap buttons i'm central
have to use that and you don't have to pay attention to that second layer that's the main
You could you could draw on it but it's not was main function

but did we reach with our a style the targeted audience that
style button you might as do it in normal computer so

she didn't have enough time to did design inside as
we haven't had time to design that's the slides that
but you have to search every time again that's what was happening
One litre true Check the time

time that was in big problem like

button and if you press a big and you get the The the
i made some criteria or so we can for evaluate our model and
and you have to press the criteria from one to zero we should we leave

The basic colours are black or green or yellow or you haven't thought
yellow light do that yellow light no not
But no it's not yellow lab that's just a bit of a yellow

you if you're going to show your prototype presentation of me
a fancy is more like the i have had a flashing lights and the colours and and that kinda so that's
and we can change the colour so that's a really fancy so
you get a fancy things for younger people you get to the static thing for older people so what you want
but still you can make a fancy if you can make a prototype of this because we don't have any sizes and

that's the one that you use if you search for a page like seven hundred and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred you will switch to your television back to texas do you'd
it the remote cans sends like the code for seven hundred page seven hundred to the television Is that if you switch it on

get back later the foreign you're taking that from ipods or a particular device so

so you can make it very easy to use you can write a lot of comments size
I i it's very easy to use but the second layer is not easy to use that's
So it is learn a ball and if it's very it's very easy to use and
very easy to use and it scroll-wheels you easy to use as if you have ever used different device

It's kinda weird a we get this information now afterwards because
we got a row information at the wrong time i

remote controls as we have a list and a less than an easy to use because east use
there's some things that they didn't mention because recharges not on the list but

if you have a i paul idea it quite beautiful it's
i did a difference it between a beautiful a fancier look and feel is the outside the beautiful like the ipod a fancy
beautiful it's also a matter of taste
beautiful is really subjective for because it has to do lots with the colours
Change wolf also a fourth one for everyone beautiful

it's to switch to the your scores playstation or
Right so if you do channel playstation this utterance to use pretty often
and single curve it curved

just write your red green and
And then we choose green the blue and red or

that doesn't a clear day the page if you turn teletext
if you turn teletext on you set the seven hundred and you'd turn it off then the next and turn it on it still stays on seven on the maybe
from those new tvs do collect all the pages That

You want to save that files Drawing
If you can you save it on the same thing it's a map are still the ones in the project a map

the third meeting that one was pretty hard you're not
Warning finish meeting now
Warning Finish meeting now

made it so we can do the project is very evaluation of our Working together
if you use it but if you want to download it to your computer Doesn't work it's not
the smartboards would be very to work with is worked really just not worth
Two got an hour to Work together on uids for

you operate that would you're pointing finger so you
So we're in the right direction because it's twelve point three euros
No that's perfect twelve and three point three
is that the included twelve euro or do
because The prices say it could be twenty euros something now and then
And then if you had that fifty euros then we would discourage

So our recalculate that still have the chip set
And would be great if you could add it from just with a mouse way setting

we we search for a young group audience do need for forty yes
but the young men forty so we
We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel and that's what the tracks the young audience so

but it's not impossible to use it if you're left-handed so you because you can use your thumb them
just rolled role second level because we need to that
doesn't roll second level wanna say all the options that are still left

and maybe we can Try the numbers should be lower a ball for so we
we should we leave you can give it a number and then we can give herself an average four hour

the speaker is very small dollars
So this is a regular chip think and a sample speaker
But is expensive the sample speaker

i looked in the reports from the marketing strategy or
But but they said think it doesn't include a home station or
Marketing said things and then we have to include them in the design

New features to new technological innovative
if we go now i'm marc for innovative that's more innovative it's it

the form the case as a drawn they're simply
simply a square with round corners So
That are all round shapes not a round corners

That we didn't follow the latest trends
It these are the only latest trends i the my computer

The the research about the comp the users and that and

i didn't have a specification of that but imagine that you have to temperature voice
This is The power indicator so you see how far it's charged up
kap two pen is warbler

if you knew that before we could have and discussion really us really quicker

I'm breaking a world record
they're a lot of mistakes because the walls are thick like this

She picked the lcd screen
