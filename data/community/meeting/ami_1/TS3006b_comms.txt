no but my screen is to reduce the size
what we can do with the screen is all the configuration options you can put that on the screen and
the screen and that and it screen menu
so what we might wanna do is the costs of customise the screen functions if what that
you put a screen it's more about the functions know than the layout
the position of the screen is also more essential than
So maybe you should decide what up phones options we want to put an lcd screen
So you would design the basic function menu for the lcd screen
you are going to make a list of what functions are are going to to be on the screen menu screen and i'm

my computers in a function properly
Functional functional requirements
I'm gonna talk about functional requirements
it's also i was also some research on the most relevant and irrelevant functions
most relevant the most used functions and they speak for themselves
we have to combine them and mitch the best functions of all examples
and then marketing research stated that users are not afraid of a lot of functions so not too
functions only use the extra function if they are really need it
that and then the basic function just on the device itself so it looks very
that we have to watch out for the if we make it for a very fashionable it that the functional functionality will go down so we have to make
so we have to make a compromise between functionality of fashionable fashion that that's for
that's why i i wanted to make a two different groups of functions the simple functions
that's if you're using the normal functions the basic functions you normally press them all but
exactly i'd but this is really your department do we need just the functional display and for curses
e you select a function like fall of like a base You
Because if you use the functions your hand will block the display
all the functional aspects of the remote in my department i have to know
we make these the advanced functions and these basic functions do we make
if you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing
and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button
and then used to functional buttons to confirm to go into something

power button and channel volume selection are teletext
you have to make them very easy so for just a zapping around channels you can just push one button but if you
Like if you have Like ten buttons for a for all the channels
so you have up and down for the channels and left or right for the volume
we have power button but that's present channel
Which can also navigate the channels and volume
So maybe make one one button and one navigation button
that's the channel and volume right i'm a multifunctional navigation buttons

So is she should have a menu for all the functions you don't use regular which are
most of the time you have one button in the middle of it says menu and then if
most of time this menu button is also like a to confirm a action so
you have a button menu which you can use directly according to we all put a spongy
if i make the the menu like i have to states which function has to be in the menu and then you
be in the menu and then you have to decide it in a way that is user friendly
Menu it or you can incorporate two different buttons or like your for your
should leave the menu button out of here and yes and
Menu button access the menu in the lcd screen
is it interesting for users if we put led lights on the buttons so that if you press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu i like that
keep it optional maybe you can go left or right end up and down in a in one menu

And this one is the the advanced one but a lot of options and functions and buttons is easy one
but i prefer we use the basic options you have
So they're not extra options in this case but i
i my is it's pretty handy for advanced a advanced functions
And if we have a larger public we have more options to sell our product
that and younger users are more acquainted with these machines so they can use more advanced functions but maybe
the simple functions for the whole public and the advanced options for the younger people who are more experience it's
I what i showed up put the the extra advanced options all model to the on screen display
that's why but it that's only for the basic function if you are going to use the advanced options are going to press to the menu button and
Channel up and down and the control of the advanced options
And the or advanced option menu you can put those
that's an options and lcd options
a spongy else the options are activated based on some so for options that's communicate with the infrared decoder

been done serving of one hundred subjects in the usability lab using the remote control they also
that dislike the look and feel of current remote controls the use of things
it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control and
there was some research on new features in a remote control about an
so it and that people can say what's that one that's my remote control so it's that
so i was just working off the top of my head and using my column common knowledge about the remote controls
but but then at the information came it was xx with all the steps in the remote control that to follow so i was trying to organise them for myself and then make the
but maybe elderly people don't understand it so so they need a simpler remote and
And do we need to a logo more remote controller
And you have in that the indy it's the remote control options so we need to menus
the layout of the remote control
if you're just zapping which are a remote control you can press the menu button and then you are certainly into the the display

maybe you can do it from your computer so the top of sweet
So we can go for the look and feel of the left example and then the screen on top of it
but it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on top
than we look wary of space left and then put a logo over there
a screen on top looks more But logical to me also because people
it on so we put this on top and then make the corporate logo
But if you if you all them at the remote like this if you put it on the top on the side i
but the screen is on top which function
top which function is that we have left

and channel settings so for programming your channels in the right order
searching for channel programming them
programme and the channel programming
so we have sound channel programming
sound channel programming
i would say channel settings or channel programming so you have
so i have to channel program is how to seek
When you should be able to browse through list which would this place all the all the values all the channels which are possible like
It's let's say you have and channel five on channel five and phone account channel anything you want to move the only kind to channel five
Or or is it too hard to to just do it all on your remote to program the channels
of it's it's harder to if you have already program it to swap so we

No no i press the mouse button
i you press a button and the teacher a goes It it sends a signal to a chip which are translates
the normal piece of paper this is pen
and then if you press said you the screen gets activated and then you can use this buttons to scroll up and down and left or right to go into function and then
what was that most of the times if the if the tvs in standby people just press the channel to put it on so we put
to do we want to the buttons to make sounds when you press them as a confirmation or whatever
but also which buttons you have to press to get a certain results And
so we have to figure or figure out a way to do that easily the out
and also make clear which buttons to press to get certainly is that's always
it's a if you're pressing up and down you can easily press the when she when you're not already at your choice

They do not match the operating behaviour of the users so they did
we have to keep all the classic functions or make the buttons as user-friendly as possible
was so not only the design of the bus buttons but look how you can push them and like that so the physical aspect of it
the design and the actual design but i've never
remote and that you can choose what the design this place or what is the
that's it's up to use the user interface designer
User interface designer can design menu For all these functions put them
so if you wanna the changing the channels thing is i have to integrate that in the design

about an lcd screen speech recognition
features the above forty people are not so interests and to not interested in the screen or speech recognition but below that
Can we do have to integrate the screen and the speech Alright
but all incorporated in the screen or just on the remote so
And so for the speech recognition part if want to incorporate that we need to microphone

so it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your from also reach the middle or you should screen
so it you have it in your hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle
was times you overrides the previous and previous one
you can concentrate more on the button placements and it's the placement of t a screen itself on the
for the problem with the button in the middle is

of action so you scroll into it e you select
this is numbers volume channel up and down screen is over
channel volume selection present the numbers present
and then you can select a number in a remote and which want to save it
but can you also say i want for for a week or on the channel number of five four
a problem mean you are you a car and channel and then it just say is which number do you want to save this and you just
to save this and you just press the number on your remote and then say a confirm and then it's a it's easier

we get an update for the audience or the target that's a group so it's above forty
Our current customers are in the age group of forty plus and the
i certainly for the lower age groups a design it's it doesn't make a remote control on noticed in your room that's
it should be designed for use the group below forty but i don't
but i don't think it's too long if we can targets the current customer group as
And we have to decide on the functions and on the Seems was it the target group we have to make be
groups that one group for the display in one group for the basic functions and

button but if you want to use you video recorder something else we should use an not phones option
they can put a screen like on a mobile phone also on top i
also because people use mobile phones and also have a screen on top So you
and you have an a microphone it can be very small if you look at your mobile
if you look at your mobile phones are just are some stripes a little holes
annoying most small phones use that in the beginning but
so it's like the say button on your mobile phone if you have an are like that or the no

It's plug in the power cable when you go back
that's we need an the word level which twos and focus so is it
use be the power button is on top i
and then on each screen this you been option to go back to it to upper level the finally
So you just have to reach a little bit for the power button if you grab
And then want to confirm a want to go one step back so
to go one step back it's only two extra buttons but if it
maybe we should use this also as an button still and then just only a back button
you can open it with the picture preview or like that

But it's not clear what you have to buy a pack your first page
because you see a clear distinction between age groups concerning the features
the features but we just have to build them in because they find it very interesting
itself so it looks very simple and all that advanced features are hidden in the screen with the clear menu
And the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote
i'm not as clear about the extra two buttons with
that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons or active now which you can use

control if you can control the sound settings if you do is like a very and now base you need to change that so
like you have the visuals of the bride this with that sliding bar and the boss and the like that for sounds and then free and officials
so we needed to integrate those sound an An image options right but like
advanced most tvs use only trouble i'm base
sound and then within sounds i trouble on base
But so we have tv options which is all this the sound

most irrelevant the less use for audio settings mono stereo page days and
and screen settings for brightness and colour and like that
so but i don't think that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway and lots of the times there is a brand present on it so
The the mono stereo option and
That's the television itself is also the options that brightness and screen colour etcetera so
your settings mono stereo pitch based travel screen settings brightness and colour

which are translates it into infrared signal of certain spatial frequencies and there
and there are temporal fruit frequencies actually and then
and then threw it at transformer it's the signal gets a boost that and then sent to the receiver on the tv and that
the tv and that if you will Translated into a function
isn't that is that depends on the signal of the of what the programme you're watching
so you have an option choose to start scanning all the frequencies it's a counters one it shows on your tv and then you can
It only has to match that the channel frequency or your tv what with with precision on your tv and so your remote

in your room that's it's actually a part of your interior of off you're designing your room so it
but that are the consequences on the marketing a part
that's a pretty hard to write the
but people don't want to sit on their knees in front of the television with that usually three buttons and very hard to do
You have an additional process or and also for part
but communication if the television it's difficult but
difficult but that's not hard part you don't have to design

size one minute ago what i
The kick-off working design
i was working on it's a number of schedule and i was supposed to do it Like this but
So working design talk
And the working design was to specify a half the fiscal interaction between the components was so i believe
we have lunch break and then we can work for
and then we can work for thirty minutes and i have
But do we have to for rights and to write down the most of my or first lunch break because

and the new product should reach a new market which is the customers below forty
we can skip this price as because i read a ball forty so we could skip the features but
in the marketing research stars also on the ages sixteen
sixteen to twenty five to thirty five to forty five something like that so
so is it from sixteen to forty is it from twenty to forty years of thirty
but i people of sixteen are quite used to technology so they adapted

i lli d and then just was typing it so that all i have to that so switch
but we can skip that because that's all the news flash and teletext is outdated that and that's it should not be used anymore the future so forget
but the news flash also stated that so it should control only one device only your television so
for those that didn't see it yet the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for tv
i called a cold lasts

i received an email so i'd like we'll use so i'd just drop it in the folder
I spend a lot of time thinking about what i was gonna do and then a couple minutes before this i get my fun to the information that i need so frustrating
this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas i haven't time to integrate that information so
Hello mit v doesn't have any cue equalising that
No so it's a text file know in the project folder the teletext can
so i this is an overview of what we discussed in our last Meeting those were my
most tvs automatically display the name which you get to the cable
kinda structure in two layers
It's a state of the save automatically
the save automatically in the project folder
