No it we are talking a remote control which prepared
What are your experiences with remote controls mean
some stupid but that was quite good the fact that you could We didn't have six remote control sit in front of you
my experience is only being given the remote control with the object type by not doing any tampering
a wonderful incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful so you've got a little
control for the when you flip over the top your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the flip over
than the telly with remote controls to silver plastic that's

design how we're actually gonna put into practice make it work
as you can see your quality of the work today is
Actually reasons the point i want to work design
i want to work design people think but on a mobile
so the top design thing what they parts you

and if it's somewhat similar to what you have a mobile phone people might find it easier to browse and maybe get also maybe
Like that answer his mobile phone but
phone but he couldn't even dream of text thing like that
I don't like say the new phones that a windows based running system
the other thing is just to talking into mobile phone design features again of laptop remote control for the
And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish is a mobile phone still
is a mobile phone still be like we plastic something that's easily

not doing any tampering with an programming using it to programme
using it to programme tv you're out of ideas and things but
but on off volume up and down and channel one to use that basic functions
time he programme this remote control is the basic with that too
in that is you've got the basic buttons just for you to a volume programme things and also

but on a mobile phone you can press a key in a gives you a menu it's got a menu display a wonderful incorporating
like that like a mobile and that menus and if it's somewhat similar
why just needs to be is a this or self intuitive and you can work out One of these things turning menus
menus On so many science it now that until call these pages and which makes it fairly obvious way you turn it a
and also and then a menu to go into With all these pictures of these samples and that's where you control recording and things like that

so we don't want a universal remote controls do you program each of you things into a pot
a pot that kept losing the signals so we'd have to

you is are having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user met maybe have an lcd display like that like
apiece it displays last on the screen displays less on

It's sitting here start standing i see
da and just sitting there searching for the teletext button like that

You got market range international and you did
just it's going to be an international market like a stray the american things like that

production cost of twelve fifty so
and profit aim is fifty million euros which is
want to i hate looking at it control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words thing what the lda and just
i you how of a twenty bottle at twelve euros fifty how much x and screen if you get you'd

So that's a problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with that's gonna be a problem
that's gonna be a problem any means the older generation perhaps and that's another
Is it possible that but for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press the large pretty light you could watch wouldn't bucks apiece it

the top of my head i was gonna do a big cat to
Big target group
it doesn't make when you pick up it does make it big complicated to look at it's

And i see them us majestic and as independent And Correct
End up and independent right you set of golf
of it are quite three spare sets Flying around everywhere Doing there and think
mean i've got we've got we have three feet here's a tv and that saying all set up so we don't want

other then we'll go to a tool training talk for a project plan
talk for a project plan discuss our own ideas
discuss our own ideas everything and we've got twenty

trendy appealing to wise
appealing to wise market but

fine that's why it's we've got a selling price of twenty-five euros which you don't actually
Half of the selling price is taken up by building
we've got half an hour the for the next meeting so we're gonna go

since you guys tracing the ones honest a specifying of a random
I'm i'm very impressed with your artistic skills mind that dreadful
Having having said that later if you wanna get one though is the ones on the market mind missed that about twenty pounds anyway So i had

And Birds of prey on a boat
prey on a boat here in trap it to
in trap it to work out and trap it

or is it going to make our product look at epc d option
of it and a section it opens up to the other functions when you can't use and or options recording things like that inside it it
Or ball playing it a chill function in that is
so why i have a quick look at the company website and it's like

And putting it's got in you shouldn't Main starts
Main starts in some sometimes make or the dream up even know and so

and so these are the two unique features i belong to do
past the best is an attempt to the t rex and then it
stay on to handed fashion

but not a hunk of metal and user-friendly
and user-friendly granny's tk it's
that they're not focusing on this market any particular think it's everyone user friendly

and draw our favourite animal on the whiteboard a preference
and so what's the characteristics of that animal server
And also my drawing scale isn't my grave site

then it sold change into pelican but recur
and you did say earlier it's got to be at accessible and usable bicycle all age groups just that
san francisco to be something usable by someone like me as
and symbols that you don't necessarily understand symbols and then

leave me a space at the post some unless all
think we have to i don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that making
space at it and in bulk it might look small but it might have
and i get to another fantastic powerpoint presentation
