and it could affect a grew up in in buying remote controls
like in the watchers but remote control can lie on the table for a date and then you push a button and so you don't have
solar cells are also a bit weird for remote controls
could be Something special to our remote control and it's possible
Whole set of different remote controls maybe can bring
i was also looking for what you said four i got the name all about lcd in front of the remote control if
so probably them for most used buttons on the in the remote control
the most important thing is a fancy look-and-feel of remote control
sell remote controls in a look at two colours no
a spongy material is very irritating for the remote control itself but
there's always and displays remote control
And Maybe i'm a banana is it's it's not easy for remote control but
It already watching the tv gonna watch a remote control
so you can use the buttons all that already on the remote control for double functions
When when you put a maybe a colour lcd screen and it's very special a very trendy to have a remote control for
Yes but that remote controls are already on the market is simple
It doesn't fit in our philosophy behind the whole remote
it and maybe very tiny on the remote control itself but
to the lawn wanna spend more money on the remote control i
We'll try way that i came With your remote control nah
Yes but the titanium remote control when you're watching tv or your hands a little bit sweaty and

we talk about the components design it's really about material and And the really the we bill the remote controls off
remote control consist of components and
and the components of a remote control could just have a properties of material we have to choose
the components of remote control the case the properties
all the materials and Components are just available and In our factory
There there are three at components three components targets the buttons

But we we have to they have to be the firm colours our own colours has to be in it's yellow
I don't think our company colours for this fashionable
harder but also on the colours the younger
but do a going to go are we going to give that to tone colour look like it the plastic mold is in one colour and thus those cushion pets around it are in another colour set the
How many colours are you are many colours are we gonna wear off on
wear off on the five minutes left my know how many colours
know how many colours are we gonna give it like to tone colour
have to think colours is very important because it has to be flash a bit and that is a an doesn't have to be in weighing day when

with soft rubber for falling and it feels could and
the buttons has to be solid two and the material is soft rubber i've got
They're they're telling me that when we build a remote control of of plastic or rubber the buttons have to be rubber to
You when we use a remote doubled curved case you must use or rubber push buttons to that the rubber
that the rubber double curved case is is it a three dimensional curve in the design which is the
the buttons the case itself and the rubber and
maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons at and the questions as should be in another car

control if that's a good idea of maybe is a little bit Too much for twelve and a half Abduction if we go already
If you get the idea the fruit rounds
i really don't feel the whole idea of an lcd is
i the idea really like it the lcd thing but it's not a good idea we have already mentioned all arguments and do
but i'd be like the idea of the plastic and a big thing because easy
i do like the idea of maybe at that came kind type of body weight and then with plastic colouration rounded like
set the idea is that a good idea
The fire i was thinking about the of the we still want the joystick idea

to implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the docking station at the bottom
at the bottom of the docking station whatever and
it this is a docking station we can make our logo over here doesn't
It's too much to maybe a week with the lcd and the docking station and
Yes it was already made that the remote control on the docking station
we're gonna have a rubber on in the docking station
on other some about the design of the docking station is something
docking station is something for the bus and i we should

another possibility i i looked upon was the lcd displays could be
with it i don't think the lcd display fits in that emission know it's
you want the lcd display i don't want to in a three the house and so it's up to them If
it done before that like the be your employer universal remotes you have lcd displays but then it's
If you can put a little lcd display on that we do lots of information but i
what do you had this you have a mode after the trailers of lcd display level
And it's a price also for monochrome lcd or colour lcd

All the things of this year are surprisingly fruits and vegetables And spongy material I found this image
I found this image which is it's symbolises the idea of fruit and vegetables i don't see the spongy
Some symbols of fruits and vegetables maybe
catch colours fruit
But how do we use fruit and vegetables in christ stick with the remote control i make
But do they need a creative artist like that to whom make it to feel like a vegetable or fruits
But pictures of fruit it's flexible and vegetables
if it's fruits and vegetables it has to be colourful
it's fruit and with a catchy colours

And of buttons sizes and i'm not or if they have to be ba or just small
we already upon the faded the skip buttons and it should and the volume buttons but that goes to that they have to be large
this part of the rc The up and the upper part or whatever it's it's not use wood buttons i so you
programs you can zap to them with the page page down button
want to it simplicity we have to big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons you don't need an lcd
or when you use the buttons as black you can use two colours as
do with the number so we have the power button we have with teletext button
it's to add a menu button for and
And you'll can also use a normal stay buttons for that the and that way we
the and that way we have like only the numbers to power button skip the volume and then at every time you would have

requirements i was thinking about just the basic functions and i got
know we decided to use only basic functions no
Another function it's aurora discuss it on the sides
when we only use basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
It puts an extra x and on the simplicity of our remotes to make these two most basic functions extra big like
the try and i also have to think about new functions maybe buttons like that and to control that's lcd
but then it's very functional to indicate which what a device you are controlling test
But it just it isn't doesn't match with that or old basic concept

welcome to the conceptual design meeting
it resembles the design and mine for the
No but that our design already resemble some piece of fruit it's like a
you can you open the conceptual design presentation
in a do it has to be simple design which sturdy you it's not
It then we can always use the same design for a greater resemblance but with new with new colours new yes
But are those design experts we will work that half

A chip the chipset and the board it'll off the shelf also the speaker
also the speaker in the remote control and you want to retrieve it and the base
and the base station is also off the shelf all the materials
the shelf and even the speaker and wireless retriever are all available in our company
it's just a base things we'll read discuss the know fees you are or that so that's
i got an email with a with an remote control with a base so
we can put the logo our base station

i've done some research again about trends from the internet
And for the idea i've put some trends for the market for elderly people dark
elderly people dark colours simple recognisable shapes so we'll probably wanna do
There's a stroke with with the dark colours
and we could bring one line with the dark colour into and
You are also but for elderly people were a little bit crazy in one maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour it
i do like the for the to the idea of making a catchy colour design and the them because i do that it dark or would be to
that's a good point and that's why i like the dark called our corporate no because

the plastic is the best with rubber of wood or titanium Would also be a bit weird
But is it possible to use both so the plastic and a soft things and titanium as makes it
titanium nowadays is way more often used them plastic
an when it's a two plastic is like some fun you can always have a round it's always
have a round it's always fun to have something take a plastic or out

the properties of the case it has to be so it's a hard material like a hard plastic with
when we talk about the materials it's a good idea to use plastic in tears would softer rubber like that was are do
and the material it was a good idea to use the plastic and the rubber
but not off which you can switch from softer works it's also too much to the lawn wanna spend
The materials you are mentioned in your personal preferences were all quite
because that's different material and then you're gonna have like to material lines of all think
a lot to our basic idea you got we're probably gonna have like to type of materials like the plastic in closer and then that's that's around it and problem lights
and problem lights we have to incorporate slides to but do a
maybe we should talk about in a light emitting

our market really likes really like set and the third
Younger market likes it All the
there's not a po that's up to the markets if it's trendy Because
In in two thousand and four you can't put something on the market which is on the ground Really
that's really just bring more designed to market

i've got a email from the possibilities of real reaction
The energy source i've got a lot of possibilities for that to
I've i got an email with some examples and that is a war were the most tiniest one you see
But i forgot the email with the possibilities And lcd was a possibility for the remote control so why
but I also i also got a possibility to put a scroll button on it but
think of the possibility to make it and completely tight same or would it be

Next channel previous channel
the two basic buttons to skip channels and to
Maybe we maybe we can make a tv guide only for the channel you're on
I have no only the tv channel with that we were for programs you
possible but you get it it implemented in the tvs and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction tv within a month off to the release of our remote control
And maybe one two axes a menu most tvs

So we want start off technical design
so but from now on warm use my pen anymore so be it just ordinary keyboard
because maybe we can start with the technical functions but i don't think it's a
but for the technical part and the material
but what are other test technical things we have to discuss

For a big team of artists
but it has to sell and then tie a title for programme or at least at a quite large part of it and then you get a very large lcd screen because
And we i said you want to make your top marks by having an lcd a but
But what but when you put a transfer and plastic A screen on top of it isn't for mobile you can
the top and when you have a table for more than two weeks she just gets annoying because it still be too flashy it has to be some

No that doesn't have to remind like takes place of the of of specifics piece of fruit but just like the round curves us i
it's it doesn't have to resemble what i already said a specific piece of fruit which is to know like a fruity thing going on in this it
and and about the fruity thing is just the shape should be for today this
for today this is fruit just round shapes with the

Yes because we have to we have to bring their logo and all that back into it
Maybe we can bring teletext to the tid the result
it reaches a different marked but it doesn't cost really much effort to bring a like a black a few more or whatever yes
But then we'll sell will need to bring out line of tvs which we were planning
Drawl really nicely of the best we can put the logo

i'm not that i'm the expert for user friendly but not for trendiness
if you save a perhaps a some tiny buttons aren't user-friendly then we wouldn't can implement that
trendy too because that's the mode it it's a it's icsi a extent and you
it's pretty funny to be honest
and especially colour lcd which is really pretty trendy but i don't think it will be too expensive
Too much coverage when you go to the living room it's too much maybe it has to be

the second important thing is innovative technology in the i've seen
set and the third point there in this order of all importance that's a high ease of use And
curves us is that is already set resembles something like a p or to me
It's a bit nineties maybe what we're up to write from to this point
No most tvs have an a menu nowadays to access the screen settings as
But that covers all the all the settings it covers everything then
A mute and the teletext and the menu
time you would have teletext and the menu and then it's so

but maybe it can be within the limits of twenty five euros
i'm coming back to the costs again but we get a bill but pretty cheap design to see if they within our limits and
If you drop it if you drop it back comes out there
In a lot of other product categories like even in backs industry a day began with a typical another backs but then they became stylish but all also i also of colours and
Like he's back began a resolution with it the goal is backs and colours and
to be in weighing day when you're gonna something's

ia is still don't have any information about the user requirements i was thinking
i've done some investigation and Right and that some information from fashion watchers from paris and milan
because the tv has to send information back to the rc and i if that's possible
The title and information about the program but

the simple electronic all chip is available with the led transmission or a transmitter
but nnn to implement some spongy
we just skip the house as easy as that so
thing because easy then it's is it sounds philosophy to make it sturdy a simple and like
yes said if the mp three player of mikey Take that
the spongy thing already comes for in the in the cushions pets and things on this side and we
What do a toilet paper roll and

i'll again be the secretary make minutes take minutes i will
I have for it again on to say i've put the minutes of the second meeting in the shared folder to
so the first part of the minutes are very hard to read because there are two documents that one layer of each other so but
it'll Will be more easy for you to read the minutes
Now what your mobile phone you can read text also so why not all
in that emission know it's like more phone row ball and
row ball and it adds nothing really
I've read somewhere that i've got some fate fees alright
we've gotta find a balance and
Sports and gaming what you find it
you all read the minutes in you can find them in the proper

like maybe radios and television also in this in the same style but
fruit is a yellow green red whatever sell
yellow real reaction
If a black and white that's on the old grey that
Can we combine it or with it yellow and black
It is a real young men and then make styles

battery which i'd prefer because of its it's no independent of
what we can we can produce multiple multiple things this is then
That's true that's true it breaks it's not very solid it's first french i'll
exactly is what a lot of them but if it was already were at war after to give it to do the soft touch in your hands and also the
and fond of of fronts like we can use on the telephone and
