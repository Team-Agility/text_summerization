first we have three steps of making the remote control for the first
because remote controls are most things in the house that falls down on the grounds and you get often broken
You can put gains a new remote control
so it doesn't matter what place of this on the remote control so you can do something
control what do you need a new remote control i already

my first question was does it have to be universal remote control
so you just say it's a universal remote control perfect

And we have to care for the strength of the remote control because
if you make the folder open its or also the strength is not as good as a normal remote control

what we know is that we have to sell this is remote control for about twenty five euros
I don't think you can buy universal remote control for twenty five euros so
i know where you can buy universal control for a only twenty use h
control i already wrote some know Twenties

i'm i my expensive there is a normal recharger
has does it has to be have to be like a different form than a normal remote controller
No so maybe you have to or keep it like a square this normal remote control

so we're gonna first a little discussion about but experience are the remote control first ideas and everything so
idea because a lot of people are lose their remote control on where it is

Or or you could the thing go one a small touch screen on the remote control
Why is she to use a touch screen remote control but it's not
There's not a bit too expensive to put a touch screen on it
And if you have a touch screen in it's f lee two different and
and a lot so lots of kids use it and touch screen is not

the remote controls as a black thing with some buttons on it's
I i said something on paper already at size looks usable the buttons on use

we have to look what the market is doing for what remote controls are in the market And the third thing is
so we have to use a big marketing euro
I if you look at the market it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries and it was minutes to expand

very important we have to look what the needs artifact of the functional design and the how the the remote control works so it's very going to look in the functional design is for the next meeting

that often so if you have a clear button with and a good like on it should be clear as so

if you buy it separately from a phone it's probably expensive but
Maybe use it as a separate option So that separately

And also for the vcr and a dvd player and
If we control the vcr and dvd player they are within it has to be clear because
maybe for the dvd pe pi if you just
this way if you have to me know if it's for a tva dvd player all the things also

know this is about twenty five minutes this meeting
read only have twenty five minutes so

just for the tv and just a normal fashion that's fine
when i'm watching tv and just using like five buttons are so

Because you sell it only from that and not with the television you sell to a part
we have to close to sell to finish you said meetings and

And what we have to think about two ways a buttons that you used often are Maybe like when you fall it open when
Maybe it's very hard to make it fall open and to that look like it's very a scroll

something on top just don't in general things like volume and the tv channels and inside things you don't use that often
you can I have the basic things on the same place like on off button on top and the tv channels one two three four as a block and the volume want on top so you can see that
it's out there on top part the basic options on top and if you follow that

You you can You can tie that in the editing read
there's also about strain parents five reading

that's and we have to make a profit of fifty million euros so we
So you can't or make calculation about how many have to sell this to make fifty million

and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge just put it in station or
it in station or you can change the batteries so

it has to be original trendy user friendly now that's
is what it that so that's the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface we
for for me the marketing expert the user requirements specification do i need to think as the user

The production cost about half the price the selling price
but i what the project the production costs are for such a thing

we have to make something Like a mobile phones that you can fold it open Maybe then you can
how much is your standards a mobile phone the charger

it out and we have to you use a different pen colours and different thickness of that and
Maybe if you hold your pen bit more to the back so

roles lonely because otherwise it won't work
these pens would be just you write it down a downloaded to work you do

this is the these are two smartboards use a few years and introduction of that one

Are you ready so all that they share can put things in the red project at four

we have to draw a favourite animal on the whiteboard And
And And say white your favourite animal so

your room and the infrared thing it must be from very good quality
