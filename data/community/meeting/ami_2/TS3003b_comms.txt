And then the decision on the control functions which you wanna include and those which we don't wanna include that
so these are the most Most important functions on a remote control then there are some one time
er be just use their general functions of the remote control
i've been thinking about simple manner to put a lot of functions in one in one the remote control so
you could you can put a lot of functions in one No i In one remote control but
He got many functions in one remote control but
banana's questions about the technical functions
and that it's function we don't need a remote control
i suggest Let's have a discussion on the control functions

for seventy five percent of the People question of indicated that they thought their remote where was ugly and
in addition remote we're not very functional fifty percent of
fifty percent of the people indicated they only use about ten percent of the buttons on the remote control
And fifty percent of the people indicated that the remote tend to get lost in the room
this certainly it's something to take into account and thirty four percent
functionality As a lot of people indicated they only use about ten percent of the buttons we should
Then as know it as a lot of people indicated that there are remote got lost in the room it
fifty percent of the people indicated that the remote control and get lost

these are three quite as punishing results remote
remote and being considered only for seventy
Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control
The results also indicated that about one corner of the people questioned thought that remote control there's rsi
and in addition to this it could rechargeable batteries in the remote if you put it in
but this other in a remote control got a lot of bad answer
i was there are thinking about source You got i missed the remote controller And
if we put a lot of effort and those we can make a remote control of the least two or three buttons or just remote it's a suitable for the market you wanna reach because it is
they don't really care What the remote control is like just take
And we have to See what requirements we need For those remote controls that you told
Like to have x training remote control
probably only people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls and Youngsters

works the user presses a button on your remote
that's conducted this for every button when the user presses a button
when the user presses a button the signal gets that goes to the led
And when a button that pressed it's goes to the chip
the chip controls the infrared bulb and prefer perhaps a normal bob you press
you press a button you can actually see you press the button
and you just press a button on the phone
which we explain a button if you press it should tell

lab we observed users' operating remote controls without them fill
and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn how to operate a new control remote control so these are two factors
if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a tv you there's not much you can again having a few buttons as possible
they're pretty many remote control so it can only operate a tv which already
but it's simply not much again on the competition when you're making remote control only for it to operate only ttv
if you have a remote control only to operate a tv there simply not a lot of buttons required
required so most existing remote control simply don't have a lot of buttons either
So it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here
since people indicate a new remote control is hard to learn and we're focusing

and them the buttons the real buttons we have to use rebecca
rebecca use quite large buttons for
So this is a schematic overview you've got the buttons
you've got the buttons the power source
which already when you have the minimum number of buttons on think there's much
But like other functions Instead of a few roof less buttons

you can see this as quite simple remote control
we must keep the buttons quite simple and quite large
it's really simple everybody knows our remote works the user
It's a very simple device technically speaking So this is
we should use d for the materials simple plastics keep
keep the inner workings simple so it's robust
we can do a lot of the design and the simple buttons which are also

that's good ideas "'specially" for the subtitles
Maybe you can Make that Another point of advantage in our remote control if we a make it a button x for big subtitles which
the remote control for elderly people are they can think of i wanna subtitles in push the
subtitles in push the button and you get the
button and you get the big subtitles

everybody it has to use it so even of all people young people so
But don't you think that if we make a remote which is a typically made for this market of that people think from That people think that's the device i've looked for although i didn't realise that so
so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people
if we're gonna focus on elderly people though i have to adapt they're not
maybe we should do some research into What elderly people like to have in
and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend
because of the people don't mind if it's titanium Cover or a just a plastic one so
that are we talking about elderly people or people from forty to eighty because
want if we want prof latest but the telephone for elderly people we can
Target the real elderly people

and they want to have a fancy remote control
so perhaps we should just stick to the basic layout
You can make a very fancy design or with putting the buttons on the right places and if you have
should be fancy too fancy design easy to learn few buttons

important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get agreement about the user requirements technical function design and the working design So that we can move on to the second then faced the first this phase
this in the case for Design we should make a remote for the future and this means
so these are two factors that should be included in the design the size
and this will also be beneficial to the design of the remote
i've got a presentation about the working design
And you only have to design a remote once and if you use high tech
So it's in my d it's it's gonna be smart to invest in dice in design and not in in the product itself
we have gotta designed remotes which is only suitable for tv that's
the targets because we're going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers
because it was aiming on the younger persons so
we don't have to focus on the on the design then but on functionality we just
the new products we're gonna make us perhaps if we design our design for the younger people
eighty because we're going to design know is for people above sixty maybe

there are some one time use function that's what i like to call
take your time we've got them plenty of time so
the hours like on off of the time i keep it look like red but
and the time to market will be too big if we wanna have that for more functions So
it only for a tv because we didn't have the time to market a lot

the users of forty six to sixty five years can say they make up forty percent of the market
so i will also be were remain profit would be Campbell
but up till forty five it remains feasible is it also greatly
Another one that's the customer is forty plus that's the markets we have to get the targets because
so we have to find a market which is above forty plus but which
Besides that the market for forty plus is like Pretty small
because it is forty percent of the market
People forty plus they wanted to work but

the power button got online and teletext
another point is we have to skip the teletext because in the real
in the real the full upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be that's the past and that it's
In addition people indicated that teletext simply was important feature for the remote control so it's pretty
so it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it
the if people need to the teletext for a soda so
Volume up volume down and some teletext buttons but
if you don't include teletext you do many people like

Then we did some research to the most relevant functions channel
them that audio settings video settings and channel settings buttons which are not really
need the one to zero button next channel previous channel
if you should if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five wanna push the next channel button thirty five times
That's true but I don't think there are many tvs it can switch channels that fast and
and so you would need like The tv would need a a function where you can actually if you all channels and scroll through it

so you've got a lot so different device like a dvd television stereo so
use display for especially functions of the different device so that
they've got their general fear of the functions of the device for a dvd player or so the play for playing or or we first state
for every device you got a of a pot a part displayed go for power button so
so it has to be visible in our design in the way our device works and
which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices it might be

that user interface of it for the taking of functions of it
on the internet not much information about it so about interface but
so we should focus on aesthetics designer user interface because
we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer of the components concept user interface designer
interface designer user interface concept and the trendwatching

what so i was thinking about was so keep the general function so i like the hours like
And you got here the general function so like the on off button so long to try to know and
if you look a whole and the whole generation of forty plus fifty plus it's in the the biggest share of the whole population now
some extra info feedback
And specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach

a lot but it might be a good idea to make a docking station and
if you just we could better at focus so long the docking station
You think the docking station we'll is allowed and they should we have
That's a good advantage point as if we have a fancy looking docking station or three
but some phones to get a docking station
It it we'll have to choose between the docking station or d screen
few buttons we talked about the docking station lcd general functions

i say no something on the internet not today but if you weeks ago
this use the infrared to send a signal to the tv the
the tv switch to the frequency or it but function it is
and transmitted it's transmit transmits its to the tv
internet is also mentions just to go In a function we can use that maybe also
pretty soon and new tvs will have internet access on them but
them but if you are targeting people of forty plus the chance that they will have a tv with internet access

and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements we should be sent
About functional requirements that's clear
that and then we have a little discussion about the requirements and design
is there any discussion possible hold on the new project requirements
Change our focus on the project i
i will put the minutes in the project project documents folder
So just keep in mind things you said about the target group i requirements and trends which we're going on And

and an additional eighty percent indicated that would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control so
but they also are very critical they won't spend the money
they won't spend the money very easily so
but they do tend to spend the money a lot easier
if we make a remote control just what we've that idea in mind we could make tons of money we don't have to
But the board tend to disagree
i if it'll be a lot more money to implement teletext as but i don't think

Then as pricing we need a great deal of people would indicated that an lcd screen in the remote control would be preferred this was
if we're gonna use a touch screen we're gonna go way above twelve and a half euros
you got quite a cheap touch screens it's they're not paying no core
you got quite and It touch screen it's a four The trendy euros or less so
Orange is the lcd screen
it might be good idea to have just a little screen on it which we explain
And it wouldn't have to be touch screen or a very expensive screen but
And with a little screen in a way that which explains buttons you could been it would be lot easier to

sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty six
and this means we would have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five
this was Mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five but
Within the next like twenty years is very slim
that would be the case and Sixteen to forty five age category

my name is fake from phone and the market expert
we have we the new research in a usability lab we observed
in addition we did some market research see what the market consists of what ages are involved
this also makes up most of the biggest part of the market so i
should go to the Top thingy slideshow
this is on a bit pity for the marketing expert i because it
I look and see if we can find a way between the functions you wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product
Yes but it's not the biggest part of the Market
Think that if we're if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like i if you've heard about it in the news the elderly mobile phone
would it would cost and a big marketing Expedition

we had one hundred of these test subjects
channel selection and volume selection but gotta turn on a scale of one to ten for relevancy the power
channel selection was also indicated to be we used very frequently one hundred and sixty eight times per hour
be most frequently used buttons should be emphasized especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons they're
you got here real buttons for selecting decide
that you told us they channel selection is important volume selection power and teletext

there's no adaptation in the air conditioning system so
but that means that you can have a little trouble of little trouble with the air conditioning that's because of
Maybe you can implement that scroll button
use look if you look at telephones and the sony telephone a scroll button which is very useful and searching names were
adapt they're not used to using scroll buttons so
So maybe we should implement the audio side

and we've got forty minutes for the whole press for the whole presentations so
so i suggest we'd take about seven minutes per presentation and
got forty minutes for all of it so i suggest
so i suggest let's start with the first presentation
We've got five minutes left it's just a small

it might be because it would certainly bruce the production costs a lot but it might
is it also greatly increase the production cost but
production cost but these are just some small factories we could consider
and we have to be very and then put in the corporate image in our products so it has to be
can be a function as But only if is on Higher the cost i
if we should do something like that it would be and it would be really good for free image of the company
For able to really bring in innovative product

because if you're going to use high tech materials the price is going to go sky high
and if you use high tech materials that come back in every product
it definitely hit that idea not to the text
And you fold materials that's a good idea as because
