So any of you have experience in remote controls
I know from because that nobody has colour for a remote controlled
a remote controlled always black but this one could
control so you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television then it's the remote
Or if we should have a target the remote control
but i know screens on a remote controls

Should it be these the remote controls where they are would be called a universal word remote control so you
if we want to or universal remote control that we see the pcb for me

the important points we have to talk about our it's functional design it's conceptual design and do you say the detailed design
So there's a problem in the design of that remote controls so we
so i would have my own design of the remote control because it seems like

that state aim for the price for the remote control We

remote controls children proof of
lake the phones and these things i at least for children
control because it seems like just a phone touchscreen remote control if you like

then it's the remote control for the sound system more for your offered you go Whatever

one thing in order of processing this remote control if you remember when people use it to be a bit never find a good but the right place For some reason

So twenty five euro for a remote control
but process when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five
And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five

my daughter likes yellow remote controls we
So she likes the buttons Which make kick so

when you get to have the kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of the new project remote control for the design for a new remote control and the project manager
and the project manager chris type of love And
and We speak about this tool would going to design And take to make the project plan Some discussion

And for a production cost of Twelve fifty euro maximum
Too expensive for twelve euro

not pretty small a colour
maybe we can change the colour of the accused of three

Just to try to who's the user interface designer According to
it could be on your screen Which we changed depending on the user or even the user Some i
the user requirement specification it's

But first ten detections you should to do it change channels you adjust volume and animals
i change channel ideas that

So colour runs that's easy to use size size

yes we have plenty at home my daughter

place For some reason ddv d day off button when they want to use do So there's a problem

Some i prefer to have the off button that the top right so i

page know you people are very a left-handed so you will
left-handed so you will assign left today is like these save director use like this so

Cn and For that to it we're going it to work individually and then have meeting during all day
And we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and

The leading anti can keep those features and then we can you make one working

very brothers to because even if she's not very tall she's the high enough so that when she throw it away it's a

for favourite animals It's gonna be not my favourite

characteristics of this animal is dangerous

but they keep generally that it's less layers christine and then that's better and then you can put you can only that one but

a menu you can easily moulded the frame

has to be original trendy and user-friendly

a given the history of so you could like it and do Present the previous Then

Then you can watch what you're are you can also record your own sequence of actions that becomes more

So your personal coach will send you some instruction or forty second
