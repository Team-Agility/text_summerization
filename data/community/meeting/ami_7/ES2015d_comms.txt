I would definitely go sour of them like an average plain old remote like that
No i i much about the remote control industry how much an average cells for but
could have that you push it down that's remote control be
support so we did as much stick our remote control

that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours so we would necessarily use all the combination
for rubber if you can visualise this in colours you would that quick thoughts
do we somehow incorporate the company colour logo know is the colour
right and the colour scheme names and
so i was like special colour will have two colours right
one colour for the case one colour for the buttons so we can
and in the special colour for the button and we also have a special form

and we don't wanna go for park because most remote controls or black or grey so we

But at is more representative of our colour scheme like the company the yellow and black
the colours are yellow and grey so

That's another number ten button
All which we have all the numbers here so we wanted something and representative of numbers or shouldn't and
numbers sex concern read it out
i'm gonna open up the second one then the slot reading i have the

at so the cat is they will send it with them a limited range of colours for this prototype are we
do with it all the colours we were given for making a prototype the colours that we wouldn't necessarily cherries and it's not

remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
that's remote control be easy to find when lost remember
it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brian you remember that thirty
when brian you remember that thirty four percent of users usually find it difficult so it

know very low might be the most popular fetus the buttons in more settled
and so we don't have any scroll buttons it's all pushbuttons
what's up button down on the page that would be really simple
just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons that in itself makes it so much easier to use
Doesn't make more sense for the middle what's been just an enter button so then
button so then you would have to press two buttons every time at least
with push button interface so that's inexpensive and

on me on average remote if you pressed ones ycd is going to all the same you want to channel twelve you press one thing that channel one and then to need just go to channel two instead of twelve thirty that like
but if you press it'll go to that channel right away that press
but if i wanna go to say number like sixty five to channel sixty five to press the six it'll go to channel six and now press the plus and then we've got a six and then put the five another sixty five
I i would've thought to be a problem they want to channel six first in like on the way to channel sixty five
my computer screen we technical difficulties so i press

so question number one Does the remote pops
so question number two that's Is it tech and technologically innovative so
Question rate it be easy

input time so as long as it happened to that
number time do we somehow incorporate
we weren't really given a last time all materials It's a go about design task so
task so we could've done it a bit more time
good we never were pushed for time or sat around and so

These numbers all work independently opting nine
or that they'll be used to wear to work out the a number the plus system but once

because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the channel changing and

people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product remember
it was simplistic so people can just see it and think this is so simplistic i do want to spend twenty five euros we have to market it

so it's a like stress ball was like in taking your hand off the remote
because it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti rsi e materials often used and stress balls so this is
but the stress ball field

on this product remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control look fancy
remember the future some users lose their remote regularly there's the idea
which affected a over a quarter of users

Does the remote pops sign
it a one because compared to be the remote ever and ever made this one will be easier to fight
that's a sign of the shape and also a personal

And this is just so you've got like eleven or twelve or Fruit reports If you go one
so average their five six eight ten eleven twelve thirteen fifteen nineteen twenty one divided by a lot then

all pushbuttons is no lcd controls so if we thinking

the agenda for this meeting is will initially have the prototype presentation there are two designers and then we'll evaluate
see it i'm gonna be doing in evaluation report together based on the prototype that we've just seen

is average there were some people they use the video input and sound and but then that's

and talk about our finances whether we were and euro for our budget i have a
and seeing if this prototype match is that what our budget can handle so
Right now fat over and done with a next step is to see if we're under budget And
intend it apart and our product within the budget that's

i was thinking to carry on with the fruit and vegetable theme the colour like a combination just to be named after a different fruit like a banana
do we think should or model and put the fashion into electronics current trends the fruits and
current trends the fruits and veggies desire for sponginess
more like two weeks is no like pictures of fruit it's a meaning it by fruit With
That's fashionable in itself having changeable plates
Fruit and veg idea

I i It might actually up with repetitive stress injury as
It could another type of repetitive stress injury that but i

Remember the managements that the that it had to be a problem
So if you want to talk to our executive managers and see if we can get away with just the rr

give to it and it just feels real difference
real difference like theory is that how it fits in the palm
how it fits in the palm of your hand
I'm a real people so the modify each colours ideas
To fit them with our areas of expertise And

and town evaluate the product as a group and
Of the actual project rather than the product

controls so if we thinking about the rest of the market It's all for we halfway in
Maybe if the bottom as a flat and the rest is

and the feel of it we've made this else can you go which is representing the united about that and a spongy we have enough

Does the sports that much the operating behaviour of the out of reach use that
so Operating costs it's twelve twenty euros

and it's not the But it's all sleek red black and yellow
red black and yellow and orange
black or grey so we want it to be standard that way anyway
the le at the yellow is ugly though depending on the
and more play dates out all the red we had so even if we

like a banana group like it never would rather than grew very low
do that because on the banana theme we can talk for this being yellow they won't
they are sick a banana and kiwi and

so i know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative
we will we don't want to be more innovative and that's because then i would have defeated the purpose so
and be kinetic energy you shake a style we do
And the kinetic energy part
we're using kinetic which is quite Large expensive three euros

You guys feel like there was room for creativity
room a bit of recounted the cost

when it lights up as a you could light up when the alarm and if
use the same lights are on the prototype but lb that

as is that the rubber as we used to come to an anti rsi and that's about
minimise the effects of rsi which was
The powerpoint slide things said would be good for rsi s
the fact She it's a last slide is our closing slide

i have a a spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of what we need to do our options and town
So with a good marketing scheme and the personalisation options so
but is not really any other options of sick support so

a sample design we want is all to be Accessible
Accessible from your cell am house and
watch what do you reckon sample or it so

lose but you were allowed creativity and things of
and the conceptual and functional Would we were very creative

that because it was a more natural movement and just going like that with your thumb The economics
with all the components that steph me focus of economics and to just a single how hand-held device you
device you don't need to use both hands one hand the whole this and type immediately can just use your thumb
I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand
a meeting on your left hand and use your index finger but is not really

si which was repeated strain injury
we may have to do some research in the the strain injury so we about

a it's a pretty simple design that
design that based on a mango week
if somebody saw that he said what was that inspired from i if you get instant a mango

so the warp or lower the points the better
i tend not at ten point at me
alarm and if it was hidden underneath a cushion won't be any point so you

is a line systems tall was it implemented
i'll be can't see it and i'll on inside because the alarm system itself

and then we'll evaluate it can the criteria that that we keys David and
Apple green brown we'll try to train dum m card key
evaluation criteria six mine

use the whiteboard it may be adjusted on right on the screen we can see it i'm
really and make if we had decided to use the lcd screen and make the solar power pack up and everything we would have been able to afford that's about the limit

But you have to buy batteries so in the long term
so in the long term this crashes city many so market it that way
bounce off each other which is call the base and
the base and marketing mean it's and what interface and it

and looking back to my notes from our but our conceptual more functional meetings i made a list of what our original requirements and goals were
goals were back to our kick-off meeting this morning and
and don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary then we

it's kurds double curved so it's curved all around another
Double double curve

The pomegranate a big guarantee and phone keychain the and
They if you can imagine that in like i was just it may beam a pay you all that's how like you finished

more settled cream instead of the others or a bit garish

Which puts is just barely in about it hurrah

Sky-high a senator gramm icsi like that

off last job it's not obvious to be obvious from outside the what's gonna happen you can't have to take me see

It turns into a doctor's cracking
