pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls which you who
fancy coloured remote control
Just a regular a remote colour and then have

and what material should we used to to make one of those from remote controls
first of all i have that's the structure some of the components is that are used a from what other remote controls form
first of all the case the surrounding all the remote control i'd like to
because it when use a remote control a lot of people we'll i dropped remote control on a break it because
so you can put be The remote control in amount station so that's charges
the most important thing people like to last year was that the remote control should be look fancy
Then you'd is the shape of the remote control
Will recognise does the remote control was
i also think the can't help but notice there's used you have a remote control would have any l
it because it is the unique the idea of a remote the speech control

and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts and just as

it's a it's easier to do in colour than a shape otherwise

the remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
a remote that shouldn't be given more curvy the remote that's
because we decided to have to remotes to the size or
for the screen i how much the actual remote should be that's the
you get some some of those and wireless mice has to be remotes
there's but if it's usually plus or men about future of next to each other on a normal remote
to miss possible to the g you just put in a row underneath it on the bottom of the remote

would only one menu for button channel volume we should also be enough for easy to use
But the remote control has no way or in the settings menu or just you just wanted to know the volume

japanese people the rubber small hands

a small because you have how much nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen
button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons are not always on the same place
because we're reacting projecting the buttons on the lcd screen

it doesn't lay flat down on table but it's
too One of the great the advantages of lcd screen just use and all sex or another as cleaning consulting and
we determine that there will not be no but that's but only an lcd screen so
it's right to the blc d screen it right and you can draw from
if we get like lcd screen it's quite innovative so that should be
main you can fit the lcd screen in it decide
any lcd screen was a rather small
but if you make the lcd screen as large as the remote control itself yelling you always gets on you
how does that work with the lcd screen
You could put it on a table what lcd screen you would have
on the screen if you make screen for called as matter to

already about the lc touch screen which is
But if you put you can put your hand there and then you want touch the screen that's

i'm going to do something about trend watching the trends from the past years what people like audience is like a elderly people liked about shapes colours Material and
I called like what's the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly and young people so
Colours and elderly people
Low order for years

use some fat people would effect thinking of press three buttons to say that
you are and in which button you are pressing the right moment

young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device itself
it a big difference between young people fresh exciting and all people
it meets more the young people than older people

In which people will find their interesting and i will buy
useful perform because people lose the remote take a
So for the older people are more traditional a four
all people all time boring
like i said know people like morse offered as a spongy wants an
Because it should be important position the people can see it because it is the unique

spots but also possible to create fancy colours wood rubber
wood rubber rubber that makes it easy to to tune that's it's of colour
rubber the total piece of rubber that's or a that's used to make the case is the same colour so if you scratch it
but if you use silver the rubber is still the rubber isn't fancy
still a sense of a when use of a rubber is assessing to
to rise to shine and rubber doesn't

a you could put an arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
the like the said like scroll up next to the remote isn't that handy it's better to

A bright colour physical forward
this is colours it was the slogan and the corporate image so you have
But i don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour
and i will buy Not faster when they look the same old grey or black the colours
i changing colours will be easier than changing
different colours but you should have a standard colour

so is it a big difference between young
d screen they don't need that big of cpu
look like it's a big so it's it's really an important function of the remote

the buttons won't get that small when a cds green is
the chip on print what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button when
same when you do the radio button on the bottom of standbys always on the same place in your own
Isn't it better to have the sound and the channel buttons

i a hand i did single covered the curved single curved
And i personally lights the single curved remote control because
how about my idea of making it And one single curve
and get a single curved rubber

will be chargeable with an option for mount station so you can
a bit larger it's not really on scale then to work an option
and then if you press the options that so then we have an example of And then you should get the other options that were to what you could do and that's
and all the people but also don't really want to use this this option news so they want to
same place if you're large a button or if you have several options appearing on the screen the colour nations aren't always the same when you do the
the scroll cs or if you have a lot of options but if you don't have a lot of

and that was option to use as a in a rather simple chip but i
so too open with would've Simple yes in the simple the
simple sepia where the synch
as easy it's quite a simple lcd screen

they like square shape of round And yes
shapes like a week you said is that's easy better or for the elderly people something like that Like the ipod do something with the round squares simple but
shapes it is something between the square shape sit around got on the round shapes

it as a set the for rubber is it impossible to damage severely the input instead
it's a options is the settings of the remote enough to tv and that a thing called cults settings
called cults settings but this is
and it's also we discussed in the earlier that's all of people don't really want to use these extra settings and all the
if you want to see on the settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu

The personal preferences for the young people they liked fruity colours like a banana yellow strawberry red and
Elderly people like a two colours which you are be seen in the autumn like them would say the dark brown or red deeper read some they like
This is a bit like the young peoples like a fruity colours Innovative all the colleges you blue red white yellow that And then
Looks something like that you are in colours like red brown they live with a lot of
i would say about like a red yellow green blue just
course the fruity colours And a two colours like reading brown light out dark red and brown

rubber is the best suits poll up material to use for
the round shapes As soft with the materials like the rubber should be soft
Real hard so rubber or soft that
but the hard part of this or softer rubber
Especially when jeanette a soft rubber like this

and so that did you say good morning or a coffee maker and it says that says do you back good morning joe or which made this and this the easy
bounces back from the floor when I
you what should also have remembered and menu to go back to the first
It if you touch options you can't go back to this the right away the
it's better to just tie That what you'd like to do on the screen is want to go back it's
is want to go back it's a big button go back if you want to

something and for the elderly people just plain old because we decided to
wants an old people like a plain wood so we have
plain normal plain
know normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose

A touchscreen makes it possible to get to go nation of your finger on screen the case
the case or or discuss case we wanna to make it

this and this the easy way to a program that you say record
that's good thing so that's easy choose people know the
it's easy to have it something like but and minus here the sofa here Minus here here

but the printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal print it so that's

the graphical user interface and the buttons we have some thought about that already
user interface are also some questions about the concepts you have some ideas
any more questions about the design or the user interface so you can buttons and
and especially noticed that be in this file design and user interface there are going to work together on for a foundering a smartboard and

the component that's the makes or transmits the signal to the television
i do not change a scroll with the menu
most and you can navigate through menu great with the scroll
what when you said the settings menu to look up some some channels on your television use is called a scroll down on a menu which probably does not fit on a screen so then

it's of colour titanium or you have to pay chip and we
pay chip and we have that's it's possible to scratchy or
chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip in it with

should be soft but if you should the feelings spongy use of sponge bob like face
and that colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
rubber which you can look and feel weird
but you can press it in its feels kinda
its feels kinda spongy
you can make it lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button

i already as explain some properties of the material and
like that but if you drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium
And hard materials like wood the titanium they those

next meeting and busy writing and b
writing and bc leading the meeting but i
to make switch it just from the previous meeting placed inside our project folder
the else overheard to the last meeting that they should we should use our own business colours those great one
the first point we already decided that on the previous meeting

it a chip on print think cases are points
cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope you have

we're at the conceptual design meeting which is you were opened

Maybe it's better to include rechargeable batteries which
think normal batteries not like to load to
The simple rechargeable batteries

But you can find something in the middle ground that square
round corners what's square
Like if you do it the square and round corners put a little in the middle of it i

And then i personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty don't like that like
and to all four of us specific instructions will be emails why our personal coach

so that's charges itself lot instead of plan yalina something like that questions
and the sense that it you ask you give a question so the device and it
Are those points Energy question mark how
question mark how much we spy thing with energy

and just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that's a great
And they should be long lasting not not be anti it's a two minutes or thirty minutes of forty minutes of use Nx
the next meeting is once again in thirty minutes here are

a slow you can make a versus the microphone to
maybe at the bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone

it with also the ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition
first there are some new findings in new technology for speech recognition and
but and an a bigger for microphone for the speech recognition if you want to implement that

and we want include a pen to point out a we
because if you lose the pen if you lose the pen you can't use
maybe i should to should show some points on which we it should take a decision

answers you and they already put this in and clean coffeemaker and so that
a question and three seconds later you say the answer and then
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer

how are we going to be a separate docking station and then
which you can recharge through docking station So

you say record into the device into the speaker and then you said

the bike little rr and r and rr on the top but to see
The schools it is in the actual design you should know where you

for of all i'd like to the come in at some of those the things i elaborate something today i elaborate
today i elaborate on the concept what should be

you use to break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses as of something like that but if you

But maybe we have to edit issue to remove degrees from all the thing
Channel selection for our one of the sixty eight Volume selection
Volume selection four times an hour

i prepared a little presentation is once again or at least an agenda i
agenda the base five presentation will we on your side
today we once again have a three presentations at home right and after that
Team member This presentation
