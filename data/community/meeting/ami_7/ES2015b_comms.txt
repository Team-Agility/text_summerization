so what are we talking when i was equivalent for remote control
watched to influence remote control
current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user
as opposed to a basic of all black all same size but in remote control so this
we interviewed remote controls are often lost somewhere so those are discuss
it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control so it
remote controls are bad for rsi
want their home every remote control looks the same so
but if we wanna make fifty million and have everyone want this remote control we should maybe
And if one of the largest power or most complain about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use remote control i'm that
we don't have The recesses or possibility of using the internet with the remote control but
the remote control so we are that it'll just be for the television it'll be one have
at our remote control for All tvs so
would be what is the same reception on the remote control i but the actual device would have to have its own infra-red signal or
i was gonna draw out there that thought about personalising the remote control

a multifunctional remote control which can be used for several entertainment devices and the single function
and the single function remote control you specifically for the television
a single function just a television itself
A single function remote control is some place to use but it means you have to have all their remote controls for older and chi minh devices
that a single function remote control would be preferable because it's
So as far as we know a single function television remote control is usable internationally
for one thing because Having controls with dvd vcr that thing would really complicated design of the remote control we've decided not to include them and make it a specific just a specific television function which is

so people want gotta turn on the tv with the remote control
biggest frustrations of the people that we interviewed remote
and that was negate the whole remote control thing because of people can activate
of people can activate the television with their voice and they will be using them they will be talking it remote i'm

eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy current remote controls
the eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy mean that
would look fancy mean that they would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control
the wheely the willing to spend money on a remote control personality as opposed to a basic

needs it and it meets the i'll a person to have a portable does that device so they can control the television from wherever they are they don't need to
five percent of remote control users said they zap a lot zapping meeting

set I taking inspiration from although similar designed built rank up with a directional trendy remote control which is celp or international they're
i was just wondering about the what can we said before about having like some hidden control so it coming out a casing
like their priorities might not be offencive remote control when they're just start night
making more complicated but it could increase the popularity of the remote

I am the user User interface designer are at
design thing for now because or try to do so much that if we can make a unique user-friendly that that is also a lot of also on multifunctional we're gonna go over budget one
control so it should be very user-friendly people
same so in my can eat it should be user friendly and unique So the

it's just information that on like television timetables what's on now what's on that on every channel one
to looks like something that we're gonna wanna do some research on in include on our remote control channel
A power which is chairman the channels that
field of research fit be if it's to have a remote if you're talking to a television and saying change channel and very handy
cells that but then you'd like a pattern and down button for the channel changing

they are they don't need to actually manually touch the television set so it
so if we lost be remote control perhaps the could be a bus and on the television set itself which you can press and
how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to Be received by the chip on television set it up
in this case it's a function of remote control which is to send messages to the television set
it be more compatible with the range of television sets making a more internationally sellable
as for signing up and train on television set Channel
although we tend to be when you're watching television but

seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly which is a quite a significant
the other twenty five percent didn't specify the feel of them are fun and neutral eighty percent of users
And say the eighty percent of users
and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons that
that would pay off thing is ninety percent overnight percent before

at the technical functions design of the apparatus is the fact the apparatus should have in
they're to be functional design options a multifunctional
casing that would probably And wall what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design as as
design as as having that would complicated a lot wall and then it
And with this will have more room in the project folder to make a more original design we'll have more money
It could be very difficult to get the specific Design
if we need to decide if that is are intention is to stick design

products now especially is so much a responsibility for all the companies are coming up with make new designs
the end maybe use it would put and that project to the company this product responsibility
You could we could probably mmi employee aside company to do that for as they would be a responsibility
another thing this for the design of the product is that we wanna create More sense that people know that this is from our company so

and glass functions we have to be included
so i'll be discussing be functional requirements of this remote control
if you remember from the email we got for a very first kick-off meeting with the coffee machine the functional requirements of
the functional requirements of that was to produce have coffee quickly so
that but n's that's don't require very for a shame if they respond bubble have

for you a large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls so i'll show you some numbers
ninety one point two percent so that they would pay extra might have voice rec voice recognition include on the remote control
in it and have voice recognition wanna look into and if we have the budget
so voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us not
i myself voice recognition scares me off so for a framing
research a sixteen boy would say you had pay extra for voice recognition intel be realise that's the remote slides
so no lcd no teletext and no voice recognition

somewhere so those are discuss with poppy how we can have a an alarm system so that people can find it
so now we need to discuss And come to a decision on our remote control functions of have is going to be i'm just gonna
but we should discuss some those other options that you product genevieve
for the meeting but we should discuss this late so just a little bit more before we close
all that might be cut problematic with copy reddish it's so
Let's have lunch in will discuss a slide or alright

on the functional side of things we found out that while from a previous meeting we decided that there's certain points do make a product unique one
although i haven't come up with the final circuit get sides can would
i will make an array shows time or obtainable as we have less function on the side of things to include in the design another
we'll have more money t going to the design side of it

for that for many l also matically lights up at first touch all
be better a fluorescent lights of these were pregnant so after certain times two
It just that the that it be might be second one battery power if there if it is a light up i'm not
this is the same way that the cell in a cellphone a light up remote ten fifteen seconds retouchable and after a touch of four if instead
if instead of a constant light up on the remote control thing lights up for ten seconds when it's touch to get
you tested and it just lights up then it gives the thing close of you have
thing close of you have all the lights off in your living room you'll be all temporally see it because is
the other because it might For for design purposes the lighting of thing might be better because the dark material has a funny colour and
that now they'll it's a huge range of different colours they could light up and as which

i wouldn't he Receive my emails later on i was too busy carry do it in their mind thing which is
i've done some marketing research lot of interviews with remote control users and some internet research i'm not you my
I that's something we cannot take back to respect the research and
Right way to keep in mind the reliability of our research

so all the remote controls must have our incorporate our logo and colour in some way so
way so it perhaps our logo on the bottom or were for you feel like it was good
We need to we probably would have to have that colour in and logo decided upon
we are you have one bite for the purposes of this meeting i wasn't offered a like a type of logo what colour so
of logo what colour so if i could be some more on the design so we can be recognisable
that i don't think that will go to g real like the actual soft plastic cost that much more than other colours

so the youngest age group fifteen to twenty five ninety one point
market if we want to concentrate on fifteen or twenty five else we could go with the fancy but if we wanna make fifty
And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend remote control like their priorities

thing if you touch the button and then it could be laid up as is

Would we be the company that would break down these so medals or
so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us cost the company
and first i want to remind you about our company motto on purpose so we believe in
it doesn't have to be the colour of our our company buy
light up and as which could again could make the company colours you could do

in the last thing here was that an lcd screen so voice
practical an lcd screen though might be something that's you can shift two pages all the way this powerpoint is working so
just a screen like a computer screen so or like
clock you have an lcd verses just normal clock
i'm that something like an lcd screen or a remote control would be that furthering that problem
i are we going to write off the lcd option

and at the very start to get a new tv set each and all the time she's
And this is conversation and then we aim at the same time although
that i will it be Applicable to one tv set so we need to decide

medals or would we contribute another group
so i we're not to figure out what age group we're targeting in it and have
for it if we are targeting young adults it looks like something that would pay off thing
I agree with if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into
we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control so

television set Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour that's a huge
and it's used on average four times an hour not as much as channel selection
as much as channel selection but still significant
an hour and as about high relevance a six point five to looks like something that we're gonna
channel settings three or point zero one times an hour relevance of three channel settings

we have to hire number of people and they might be more expense of
so this something that people care but it's not it's not ignore in the household five
and very handy members you haven't household so in may be
design we want to know people want their home every
So the other might be able to a lotta gadgety for some people
The same signal three then you could just like make a little beeping noise is not that expensive
so the big buttons think for people are officially and had to go
any could maybe of us if it's that softer rubber material be better for people with else know what's it called

that's fine with Channel changers that a lot of the numbers game rub down if they're printed on the button
no it's a button that you press the menu at the menu pops up by having use to
And you have page numbers like for the menu and
for the menu and you press the page numbers with remote two and they're gonna come on
and as you say make numbers can wear off if that is like pink it printed

before we go into more discussion on what we want This design to look like i have to see some information from the management that will fact some of our decisions
is another thing that might say affect other decisions is that the management feels that teletext is outdated because more people using the internet now and so
decisions so it's out of our hands at this point
The completes most of our are more practical decisions an
to do we need to reach a decision on that right now because we need to investigate

another pay more profitable as a team or some plastic and
and then that would be more profitable like as a sideline to the remote to sell you
sell you could buy extra

but the relevance of that button is nine and ten so people want gotta
then so that bad and our users found was that ten of ten
for volume selection to ten at and it's used on average
up arrow down arrow for volume
see it because is filling out what it for more than what ten seconds so

from previous researchers have hard on some other projects with leds about smart materials flat specific how ease of medals have a shape memories so they can be he say
apart from there that's that hold altogether would be made out of the shape than reality and that's
and then the company could than just use that make use of this shape memory on all these two space that the i heard of that and then
at the fact of these shape memory i know it is that they don't need to be manually the be constructed like you don't
multi function controls can be difficult to use as a lot shape of buttons can be confusing

agree with this does anyone object and find be multifunctional might be a better way to go
used and how important that users find them so the power button
my guest as for my findings looks that one minimise buttons
use of find ability is important
right if we're for minimise a balance we're not gonna make them actually larger and there's something on its

so that someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it and then once they contributed then that company can break down the part the parts better
and that's the parts that it's woods allow all the other parts to be separated at the end maybe use
and finally my personal preferences and parts
parts a party really should be unique design

which is a quite a significant number the other twenty
you could see the number decreases that's with all its interestingly enough twenty
interestingly enough twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount that would are willing to pay extra so i we're
that ages like from thirty five to sixty five or shall or numbers probably won't be as concerned
Early twenties it's kinda it's good

who's famous for tv shows are being watched
a tv has like information has information on holidays and use entertainment no
that and us some way it could have some universal connection to like the stock at the same socket that the tvs supplied from
if you wanna go with tv show themes like a bart
it we could again else is out by advertising certain tv shows but

buttons which we're all familiar with when we using a mobile phone for that for many l
Right so might be very appealing of we have very concise buttons and another thing with
And actually go with that i'm gonna give you some statistics on the relevancy of each of the buttons how much they used and
is working so they don't have so many buttons to deal with
Or over a parade just the same as the mobile phone mickey just

So the benefits of this a product to be that when it came cn do this product like if it was heated so everything with spring apart so all
this product responsibility to get rid of what they've made and then the
they would be a responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made for certain percentage at
so we believe in providing international market with fashionable products
so for a framing to make this an international university universally accepted product and for

because it'll be more about how what you guys are bringing to the meeting today
So we need to think about how we could bring this in technically know we could use it only related
i another thing we may styles on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of a design
been limited and have to be very environmentally conscious
a lot zapping meeting because the channels a lot there you

so they can be he say it's o and and called and then you change shape of them so
it's obvious in commercials come on the changing it so
come on the changing it so as you said we wanna durable but in that's not gonna write down then

of this sounds a construct a ball metal it allows for recycling materials so that
because of this properties the smart material all you need is
a week me possibly to incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers and cells and be made out of some the dark material that

this one and down Being don't touch the powerpoint for at this meeting is in very necessary for myself because it'll be more about
touch all we could use fluorescent materials which
bubble have to also avoid parents responded to the slightest touches that's a problem

materials which would just i'm taking the light during the day in and as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark
the glow in the dark fluorescent whatever system it's go ahead does everyone interest
and had to go in the dark like that point make any difference anyway so
Did we want to go for the glow in the dark luck Or do we
did they might be perceived as tacky on the dark it's kinda like e
the dark it's kinda like eds neon style ways are gonna
I was thinking of was called the dark you put the real reaction some ball at school in the dark and then it would be constantly put rice

and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design a just an electronic fashion so that it's something that
we should be looking towards trends in both closing in interior design any trends
any trends that are going on in the public even be the who's famous

here's some ideas for you a large percentage of
the shape of them is really good idea and that's a unique

colour and a might not go with different like face plate so we make a lot of
it you imagine face plates so i
so if there's something that Different like five different face plates end of this to start
plates end of this to start making more complicated but
like a bart simpson face plates But
could start off with three in if we had a big then we can add someone

right welcome back from to the second meeting and sam
and sam i'll be happy to have the last thirty minutes
you happy you have no objection back with it like that send
maybe selling adhesive that you could x to come to the back of any set that would be not very intrusive all
very intrusive all the seasoning small that's that's

so i saw it does a like a high comes out that highly a quality machinery in if it machinery but
I'm probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with our a wider range of devices
it's just that one we're creating that we and we have to make at compatible with different brands of devices and it
and it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices it and older and
So like a running banner underneath
so the older generations we should be catering to a bit more

to scrap metal something like the case if it's scratch does anyone wants we use it but you might be able to market down and be sick and somewhere else
answer motto we put the fashion in electronics so
and especially if we are trying to be trendy go with fashions things like that ages

them so it the screen that's holding something together could expand then it would force all the components that part So
so all the individual components could be easily separated and some could be we used some could be recycled and that be
like you don't have to individually and screw all the screws because of this
components is will be how with the wheel actually work let's have
sides can would call those components in
and another thing with lots of surfing probably have to work on something that could be a lot more durable because that's fine with
know what's it called rsi what was that wouldn't work

idea one thing we have to consider is our one hundred percent turnover goal that we have for our financial sector
Alright also have to investigate the financial implications
approach i have to see if that can meet our financial goals as
because we need to investigate the financial implications

and so we want concern ourselves with navigating the teletext option
Where they was the management suggesting use of the internet about the teletext so just avoiding both altogether
but another thing is that if we're reaching international crowd i know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext would be really superfluous
i missed the last moment reading that what we're talking

The first presentation will be looking at is poppies presentation and
press and the alarm from the handset would sound where it was hopefully in the room maybe behind
it sounds very labour intensive we have
And sound next presenter will be tar
are you ready for all your presentation tonight
or like an alarm clock you have an lc

'em bits and the basic jobs you can wear out with time all not usable they might be like Bill that's going to scrap metal something like
Repetitive strain injury
repetitive strain injury

but just raise what's the energy source it could be a
source it could be a battery like rechargeable
