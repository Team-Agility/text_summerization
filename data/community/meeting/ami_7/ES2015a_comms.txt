i'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase also
i also be responsible for the functional design phase the conceptual design phase and the detailed design a off the user interface

you to design it you think you can decide what direction you wanna go in but at this point

and then after we've brainstormed in and out but we can come together in a meeting and discuss what what functional design we want to use same

Some remote controls are those a hidden panel it's all those buttons that you don't really use also programming that's useful

and as a team building a moment i'd like us to try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal on the carrot characteristics of that animal
My favourite animal which changes all the time

if it's a trendy original aspect were going for you to design it you think
And key issues here is being trendy original and

This is the team building time where

We want this to be a marker will product that can be trendy

The way that we're going to go about this is will have a time where we can Come up with new idea it's a loan and then work on the project and then
time so that's the time for us to bring our initial ideas any Suggestions that you may have so far and

buy a look and it is my favourite animal right now it is a large beautiful majestic feature that
my favourite animal would be a talk but i

while you guys express your favourite animals
so that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow would seem to say that like spring is finally here

i'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for a new product

the next thing we need to it rests is our financial department to meet our budget
or not present but bring to the meeting

We can Like the price to create it will be significantly less

uid the technical functions design will be worked on the next thirty minutes
thirty minutes Maybe how this can be achieved and

One thing that so are we going to do is become acquainted with be that will so we have access to for our project one

at wanna make this As a selling price of twenty-five euros and so we have

generate on the marketing expert an
and we need the user requirements from a key man it marketing expert

you can press a button on your wall is it always gets

times our next meeting will be in half an hour said half
half an hour said half an hour to think about what you want to present or
you will get specific instructions of what to do the next half an hour and i'll
an hour and i'll see you in half an hour

so you just have like the number buttons power but in tv video but in

talk but fish eye feature or i'm That
I draw talk at school

It's really big arsehole you going out of its head
it i reckon then big a list of did that they

we'd like to To make fifty million euro something that's the end
we want it to cost absent maximum of twelve euro and fifty cents

thing like a novelty thing my any sell a few things rather than like in general More acceptable but we don't

that's pretty on the line to buy a wanna be look at it for about two minutes or we should have a camera

With a microphone so test where but it's a cat
a lot but i like also to animals that further when i'm gonna draw a cat in memory of mine look at that point we cd

I find in the dark it's often hard to know about in your pushing

or not need our budget but more but what a selling range will be looking at

and it needs to be user-friendly for maybe if for people that can see the numbers as or

a butterfly which is a butterfly yesterday that seem to be like the symbol of springer and is actually pretty is but
doesn't know this part of the body was really tall and then i was like the most colourful exotic butterfly have an like once is not

completely new styles so that can really appeal to generation that doesn't want a simple plain that channel changer and

As as if we had having to have it like make each profit out of this it needs to be quite a university except the thing like a novelty thing

And then a kind is a green as a green range and there's
green range and there's like a red one i like this

and is actually pretty is but if i've ever seen the wild that speak once
wild that speak once call it was like
