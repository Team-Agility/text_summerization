No the findings that we came up with just to recap are here at the criteria that we
criteria p criteria on be technologically innovative

this is a look and feel presentation to find a final presentation and
at the criteria that we want in this remote control or a fancy look-and-feel technological innovation it should be easy to use it should incorporate current fashion trends and the with the two main
criteria any the fancy look-and-feel how do we feel
how do we feel about this prototype model relating to find it is a fancy look-and-feel one is
and the spongy feel is no problem with that

state of the evaluation is really for as a team to a value we if we have no got a product specification and prototype design but to the criteria that we call from our market research so this
it should really good that this has been very market research base because

mean really mold on a prototype and lighting
Do we feel on the basis of that of these evaluation findings we can go ahead and i could use this as a prototype and marketing to be have

buttons with a combination of lcd and rubber current design right funky
and the rubber buttons that we use will be anti rsi k
All that i could button that we can even the bottom half of the tv all minimises rsi it's meant to

is but the very use of the remote control if you're someone who's that thing sitting like that we found so many people get hurt you minimise that such a small device

their innovations another people don't really people want
people want in a model of the for the really happy with the can't
innovation for money's sake That people have to
within budget and it still makes such an innovative eyes and people really gonna

No black and white touch screen and people
And then finally on the interface the top screen
the top screen as you said is would be in set black more lcds touch screen which

you mean side with already said to decide on the kinetic batteries which
back real soon so but what kind eighty how would we put a standard battery
If we moved away from our much loved idea of the kind battery just went with the standard battery is that make each day
And people are used to buying batteries are not
to buying batteries are not gonna say i'm not getting this is about to buy a car shaped remote control
if we change it to the battery it's that's minus three

is the control of sound files
Do much power from having a huge break
I don't for the remote control with the flip top
as we should invite your presentation with all the other controls remote controls no one's power supply it's it particularly i
does anyone remember the right control con you get the
really think about it because normally the remote control is in the product which that are on a ship that china shit

cheap so it has something like what you chance that where is the remote and Ellis shall back on here
on a double that back to be something to the next time maybe you can have
on the thing and finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics has that you use
so we can come back to that slide if you don't have a notice that it's all to
that it's all to see how we're going to evaluate our own feed back to this to what we have so far we're going to
it would change the back real soon so but

And The Be top lcd screen you can see that would be self And you say it's it would be sold in set into the top and the buttons
the top and the buttons of the bomb what to say is sorrowful
It's a pretty in the top section on the bottom sections
bottom sections it's top part that's
and now we if we also decided on the inside we could do possibly either have some sold that sold a logo on it and say maybe an engraving of the later on the top
It's top secret it's it is this conspiracy so the this

It's gonna have a plastic body with a as a standard colour by the were thinking some some like fairly neutral like white or like close think this is

right funky designs and start by fruit keeping with the hip feel
And it's an assault clam shell design And
and the with the two main ones that with the spongy texture and he fruit and vegetable strong design colours the design should minimise
and fashion trends that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours

and there are fairly easy to hold a search
easy to hold a search resume that also be quite cheap so it
the design should minimise rsi e and easy to locate
And finally last but not least easy to locate so we talked about

of things i don't think that's something we have to look out and find a way of raising the couch or

on it where's the but the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons like that for volume up and down channel up and down power on and off and to things to that affect and now

the white choice of colours and so pass and say you've
the base colour was why all like all a light plane but
plane but the changeable fat faces with that allow you to get any any one of the number of colours the it's false customers
So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours that's what we're tending to do
we don't have many students special colour
Might there we go for some of the more exotic over jeans and so it's like colours
which shape and colour so that's something we should income problem

fine be battery anymore for that type of phone because

and i would just do a preliminary of rating of all those criteria on the white board here is
so want to separate the ratings by the peaks and
so i'm just thinking before it is it my rating you limited in the use of materials for your prototype here is that actually
the lowest rating we've got which is really no it's not terribly low it's
for most of those ratings high end of the upper end of this go ahead with that i really doubt it
would be fun because the exchange rate make it

think this is underneath be rubber as the rubber at the outer casing which
a that's the spongy feel would be in the rubber so you program that otherwise
a somewhere else we can code for the rubber used to the casing to do
completely and just actually making the rubber case the curve thing is

so this is the first stage the evaluation data collection
Is it everybody's going to evaluate or just to market
How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information

No it's not ninety nine know i'm interfering with the lose the whole look of the product when it's Hell on the thing and
do you realise that we might be doing fairly biased it is our product
We haven't been giving we have in dealing with la's there
euros now because they're saying they're quite willing to pay more for better product
a lot of light and the final product if it was actually If the if we'd seen the marketing the fall the initial specifications but maybe it would have come a little different but
and new for television and products coming up but a giving
up but a giving the much ready to this excel was thing i would
it's just that the dot adjust the production cost of the five

If you need someone whole time you get sick like a needle whole time
we probably will as you stay at your email system mall i had we actually Had had more time and if we'd been separated mall
I didn't have to rate you on how much includes the meeting time

and to try to incorporate voice recognition software interacts i until we can find out more about the cost of things like that
we decided the the voice recognition system that did actually sound email that they ways of coming in and there are fairly
we were still a slightly on the list of to use voice recognition that the that it
can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition we could do voice recognition
we could do voice recognition for this class like it upgraded version you could choose

that we happy with the costs no it's it's going to be feasible cost-wise
But it's gonna be part of the total cost was nowhere
you said fifty percent of the cost so how
So it looks it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit you still

and we'll come to a consensus reading action one and seven
it incorporates car and fashion trends that
you feel about this we've got our got the highest reading of meeting the specifications that's definitely true for two or three six criteria clear that is for incorporates current fashion trends and it's easy to locate the lowest rating we've

And Because all tvs use this the same infrared medium we'd just be
So when you that you got a pen it would be facing the tv And
we can adjust the volume not just as we could only one tv Some this in the other really more tvs in this range so
fun and means whiteboard digital pens except for what does that mean and it is yes

data collection of the criteria as we saw one the previous meeting was based on the user requirements trends found in a marketing report a marketing strategy of our company does what we discussed
are we actually meeting was trained on requirements
in agreement that we were given that was very specific we've done not required
and you've got the meeting summary in question and as we've got about

to you does the design minimise repetitive strain injury
not terribly low it's closer and you troll is for the minimise the issue of repetitive strain injury Do we feel on the basis
that i really doubt it On the basis of our technology rr capabilities we could actually do much more to minimise that

Standard chip and the second coming there's different sizes it wasn't
different sizes it wasn't can be a problem factor We
the standard there's a standard transmission with the tv using teasing of the standard chip so we've talked about
with this size we go it's quite small but with a minor
As a regular chip on print and

we've discussed that we haven't really come up with anything that We stopped feasible which is that we've talked about point
see woulda been handy to have this beginning
speaker tech way that they'll make it twelve point three five
Delta Twelve point three nine Is
Is it twelve point five is it twelve point fifty
are they going to really quite a lot but it's handy The points new one every year Which is less
and all the points all raised seem to have been source now but

our costs are below project with recommendations
with recommendations to me the project be increased by
you think that takes into account Overheads Like arts being paid thing and the heating for the building do you think our party increase everything all the costs are going at
to that so maybe increasing it's You would also have to increase the price to be sold out but
to do and what you have a project team or any project for us to look at those things i don't

look each of those criteria that i've just mentioned a call that's
mentioned a call that's like a cop and i would just
you still call all of the overhead mind to that so

Maybe we should think of branching out into the children's story from a mobile phones if i don't think are thing
Surprising to me is like the people don't we do a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones like every I want to see you in your lunch like that and new for television
base because it just going back to work for the means is the first changing remote control devices be save it all be some possible we see a mobile phones
we see a mobile phones the law not as we
that type of phone because the phones that they've done things like that yes

i like the fact that it's we could it's a an idea and it be suggested that was the best idea but no one fell short time you
the law not as we reported widely ideas from their innovations
maybe we are gonna steal or idea from fellow i

which actually think you better now you could also probably attached to the flipping a pen and shot as so
are all work out the average for that gonna get is a very slightly
N if you didn't hear in the rain used any and then you realise it wasn't in that room you go into another room
there's slightly different systems been shot in
systems been shot in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else it is this

go mean if you could have something that's proper funky thing a funky item that's individual to you they could even go
and they design on fudge shop and then
fudge shop and then you just get it prints on the plastic good

we decided to use the kinetic charger
s could use it with the number racing pc
you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells that should just

which that be so whole wide choice they would be attached

different liza would need to separate pcb still be joined
we had a separate asked them so much interaction

the data and the infrared And centre would be on the on one of the u but they bottom line adjust to the front of me then we have
but in relevant areas we've been able to given taken adjust
It's a borrowing from other areas it's bringing things from other areas it is

plastic good pray you pay a
pray you pay a lot extra because
lot extra because it's individually being a plastic with being made for you but

one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker
and i it's a samples sent sample speaker

what to say is sorrowful eat yes Flat
it's quite obvious just big buttons
But then when a everything is really smart and you've just got this big chunk of like saying say in your coffee table doesn't go

function the case materials could be soft rubbery changeable
that was also on the sideline a thought maybe having a beep or function

Gene we discussed leadership and teamwork
Teamwork you to create it that wonderful specimen of a bit later model
say and it's wonderful our company so r and da

that is that we've got dvd player does anyone remember
on a ship that china shit the dvd player the video apply the tv

share a set that would tear do you wanna
would tear do you wanna join a should do you wanna hold it and i'll
b still be joined at the hinge three some sort labelling And

Missing one decimal places that's
because i'm not gonna get to philly decimal places like

as we've got about fifteen minutes to catch up with that but i hope include stop
include stop it delegating it in my role as project supervisor so good

the i don't see why we have to sell at twenty five euros now because they
to tell twenty five times to use Twenty five percent
so much that we need it to you bounce off each other i necessarily sell
i necessarily sell hard to listen to but in
why on a scale and round was listen to you and

a terrific watch out for that Typical

else just a are gay to use similar of act it it was

i press the in That's cream cup right
