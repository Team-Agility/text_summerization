we all know that it's a remote control we're gonna be dealing with the first thing we
so the things that seem like absolute must have this would be a volume control
remote control unit is gonna look like it's an ir and r
So it's gonna go that it's gotta look in new and something fashionable if remote control
if remote control what i've telephones can be fashionable then maybe remote control units can be
so we don't like the look of the remote control eighty

so it's at five percent of users find the remote control ugly so we don't
eighty percent of them would spend more money if the what remote control look really fancy we
with that current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user

we was that we're designing our marketing television remote control unit we're not
From marketing report we observed remote control users in usability lab and

We decided that is very not we're going for a basic television remote It's gonna be

Then on the remote control itself will have baby send if for the signal which could
as far as the infra-red signal do we have control over know how far away you can be from the receiving that the tv and still have it be operational mean

and as far as methods i was looking it Looking at already existing remote trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there

we just one disk of losses so that people are gonna so this in ten years time say your remote control get mean the best a strain injury

and if it's twelve fifty per unit i
this know but is any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years because

And so on the research that i was doing There's two types of remotes ones that are
In it is a physical enough of like a physical switch or physical cover for the remote in something like that then it's

the change i people want a remote that's familiar That has their favourite functionalities and does the basics but
so we can improve what's out there anything that The basic functionality that people want

thirty percent of the users say they only use ten percent of the buttons on the remote so
the twenty five to thirty five euro and thirty five to forty five point seven percent What so so
a as a team like fifty that's thirty five percent

floppy up to the age of thirty five saying they wanna
so that most people that have the money people from the age of thirty five to fifty five it that was

and of the chip will be controlled by the user interface
So i'm doing the user interface Design
seventy five cents of users say they zap

i've had a word down from head off that's something we should be centre that so we should take into account Is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit

he something easy to use especially for older people
has to look really flashing would be people to buy it and it's

a new remote especially for the older generation i know my
one and needed to be older generation but
older generation but the younger generation who we are catering for like for some money nowadays do want to watch that speech recognition in remote
But but to the younger generation have the money they don't is

sounds like you have a good year it on a overcomplicate things we don't need
it's rather busy there are so let's a player movie stop really fast forward of this Freeze frame in this
i've never seen that with and then all my years and in the remote business
it that was been working for twenty years
fifty years because technology you would change them we wanna televisions in ten years time So

they don't think people watch tv maybe to what think you change and channel that's the rest I

of remotes ones that are engineering centred in ones that are more user centred it's i
So the engineering centred one is provide a lot of functionality but it can be a little bit overwhelming
so user centre once you should focus on ease of use

How we have different colours of the remote system you can choose
system you can choose different colour like
No one colour but the pattern needs to be recognisable
But it could come in different colours and have the rr colours just somewhere like just

and they also a remote to get lost in the room so and then we can find them so
told is as i've you guys find out if you can if we can email to each other
Can you all to email me your email addresses

what this meeting is all about Is and i have some presentations from all three of you what you've been working
So the working design have got a very quick presentation on this so
my presentation why didn't mention it really is this a like the ergonomic design that

because we need to find out what people want before we make firm decisions on this So
total number of people tested one hundred just so so that
so so that hundred people tested and these were the findings so

but if like you on the phone the other room we need to the television you don't really want to go and we put the time for them to go into
either you will if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room you

it become money it's from all say from other products and yellow with blue going on them
So we have the trends i could big yellow and black remote as far as that as maybe
Is it yellow but it was yellow and blue i
blue i so it was blue buying a yellow background but i might
sec on a white and blue on a black background we went with yellow borders Maybe that's

design that we can make big improvements over this to you see here
Now come back to the industrial designer that

text was time to learn how to use a new remote
And this is something like a mom down from the higher ups a
from the higher ups a seminar be all the time

People table for me if there's a big job of the floppy

meeting if you have no time to prepare one you can draw on that note board didn't talk to
i'm gonna draw it on the board it's in blue

then if you like fifteen to twenty five this is ages
five this is ages are with that A script the fifteen to twenty
the fifteen to twenty five said like to write one percent of them said yes

they will go to look at this remote control and it in disney recogniser that's a real reaction product
do it be have to look at the product and instantly now it's one of our products as opposed to a sony
as opposed to a sony product or a panasonic product it's got
so maybe so you can have a look at our other products and see if i owe follows similar line perhaps

Then we're gonna have what from age your presentations whoa
whoa talk about what we actually need as a final coming together that all
we can so we talk about the layout in my presentation why didn't

for as far as i know another that existed like you said in the mobile phones are inspiration
i know my grammar but this like mobile phones things

This meeting is a little it's probably don't about thirty five minutes now so a range
so a range of your presentations to not be too long five minutes something like that
If we sit for finished five minutes before the meeting supposed to finish saying that means we are next five minutes for lunch

one thing that can include here i forgot that we talked about last time was doing some lock a function
have you fans that anyone else to just looked into the locking functional

But this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting
judging from what we are talked about during our last meeting a gather that's what we're going after another direction
considering get icsi define the l the next meeting

And Bursts and that will send to use the telly itself and infrared signal to use which are warm or switch channels
mean maybe we what we would strong signal string
we can make the signal strong enough to go through goals if you want to

That is like it's that there's always changing batteries can get like annoying the battery's down and
I so changing your batteries once every six months it's not really a pain for
we can look into using this would be know the little tiny weeny batteries a lot special long lasting batteries

Repetitive strain rip repetitive strain
repetitive strain injury right
repetitive strain injury so

top down keys for that channel
channel keys up down but that also numerical
but that also numerical keypad so that they can use key directly to the channel that they want rather than going up down and
that's flicking quickly between channels
you wanna navigate the channels quickly i

all to the energy source like when power
and that would be infrared energy source
energy source to be batteries we

Which will be cents buy it an electronic chip
And our motto is we put the fashion in electronics

also with with buttons called rsi e so reef
maybe the buttons so how so you don't to press so much we just like flat
There's a logic least it called rr
like just a round them up button could be prr logo all colours and

ergonomic there's my three computers are very ergonomically keyboards and
we should probably console with our legal department
we can do some real in our department that the ergonomic department we can make some really good improvements

names are just for one thing done and it's marketing this system is that At the bundy know you names again i'll this can leave
in the so the overlaps with the marketing person a because
keyboards and that could be one of our niche is the in the market i

when you haven't been getting hit with spam when you're computers and you don't thing at city questionnaires and things but hopefully
we're not the wood designer some way you can plug in a headset to end and connect your laptop computer and so
as a then if you got been getting those of crap spam a new computers

maybe and also we asked them whether they funded whether they'd be interested in Voice activated
so the majority seven forty five to fifty five euros for some reason didn't want a voice activated one and needed to be

it's probably easier you the project manager
But in the project announcement you've got p addresses so project manager
so project manager it's parts bin one at sam i

talking and i'm gonna be making notes and sending them up to the power supply and

I would say sky i'd say scrap that's trade off

so this is researcher we also gave participants
we also gave participants question i have to fill out total

What about this from the perspective of our manufacturing cost and if it's

so maybe tracking device is a good idea

it's i if access the web page you can show

Tape sense of cake that smoke them if you got them
