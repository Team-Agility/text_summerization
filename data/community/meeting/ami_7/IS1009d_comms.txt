And the button buttons part will be explain brief fancy
Yes the buttons are all grey east right
i like the idea that be on off button is a really prominent place that's a really
No these are the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons or yes
so that we could we can just have small buttons and more buttons that is if we want to have more features that
do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having to mute buttons and

Should be child friendly design which few buttons colourful
up to date and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so
that button supplement special colour

No the material is plastic and dow for the buttons that's not so soft rubber
because you'd be touching the buttons more so it was soft then you have to
Rubber because we don't have the soft buttons

The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the
i will there be an easy thing we number buttons like that people they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what
Yes it could have these buttons we have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons would have so that's yes which can be easily

buttons and the way this is shaped even though it's gonna be hard plastic it feels good in your hand so that's

No that's a special feature which we have include that this but then
what are our special features for the marketing that's really the voice
to interrupt that but record remembered that there was no that was not to include it that was there room for any special features so to be we are that

would have nine channel buttons and next but then volume but and stop type of buttons switch to control features scholar contrast rub yes etcetera

an switches things this is a great feature hard to consider
To do with that maybe one or two feature should be double up on which we could call on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on
so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really given home
we decided upon including certain features are the remote these features

voice recognition is our big selling point is nobody
And the voice recognition they're gonna be are two selling

And one more feature to speak we have all would have for this remote it is an artist a shape i shall shape
the things that i was thinking and no but my wish list is really then realised in this prototype i wanted the shape to

We want to include that's two buttons for in pleasing or they can be using the board in
We have included about that but as flawless and green card and

green card and this is the menu button which will control of the colour sharpness blank yes

From our point of view one is the most important factor is that we should get to market before our competition does
and these points are an important for the marketing these are in how i feel that
feasible from the production point if you and feasible former marketing point of view

And bm also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels
or and these two are two a scroll the programme channels
Scroll up a scroll on the channel

the decision that we talk last time it us that these special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser

she feels that's really what people want to die
thought paradoxically the other features in other words the lock the feel and a shape that's what people are gonna get in the story they don't have a television

my method for us but the marketing of this thing is first as the big question will itself and

us beach recognition is one of her very for it favourite personal feature she would like to see to be integrated in this so In this new remote
But the ray for personal favourite really she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote the industrial designer
She would like to see a time or and or all armour facility integrate it technically
then again if we're gonna do the speech recognition thing we're gonna they're gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the speech so

Should be battery operated And would have to special cases

colourful maybe vs star shaped or other shape buttons
up this as a as in estimate shape so of it is attractive
this but then It's an elongated Shaped but there and this is slightly flexible so if we can start
i wanted the shape to be bio warfare can do one anything with angles a little square one to be comfy and round d so we've got
that's really excellent shape the size is

And and is it this remote as in the twice recogniser which will recognise the use those words and then you to act according to
in the fine and saying that was no room for our voice recogniser
But we have no way of presenting that to management and as as a finished product and saying we still waste recogniser are the costs so much
we need the we need to leave space money wise for the voice recogniser

Too many new features are too many points would on you can choose matter so
point is nobody else seems to have that in this price range
with it so they'll be our main selling points so
maximum we have another four point three euros so four thirty

she would like a special case made out of plastic side is very strong not using any harm for materials should be recyclable and it should be colourful
Case materials supplements plastic
And special material rubber wood yes

she presented also an oversized remote our which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose
Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation
And i'm supposed to present the scale on the white board
and push it may be all had slides presentation was made a little easier

me that this is a model of the remote control which we are going to fill up
that everybody's gonna say the remote control is practical
To list remote control on the block so we have
just fill in the yellow boxes

that's really the voice recognition that's really unusual
play with the visible and then the voice recognition
be head looks and voice recognition

Designer i that it looks would be very important on this your remote And
the industrial designer presented for the sports on the issue she would like
should be trendy design compact and strong and should

it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel she feels that's really
And then now for the led for the light emitting diode it as a fruit was sent to you and it's
wanted to feel to be a soft as possible we'll have the soft
Anybody else any other comments or any anything so you feel we should evaluate

Marketing expert to our who has to finally come up We just to market this product has been watching the competition has done some research on the internet and also has used for personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote so it should be small Easy to use and it should be eye-catching
because we need the symbols we're going into an international market we can have anything with language dependent
and we could have some little comic a factor on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail like that that would that
you wanna do is next slide marketing expert

that size a small the colours bright and
the colours bright and warm which is what we wanted
to seven and we're right in the middle as far as other competitors At our colour
At our colour it's great colours or bright
colours or bright and warming really do great job there and

Sell it right you're trying to change protect that's
groups we don't want somebody to suddenly come to listen tell us that this button is toxic and some charles what do we want selling so we have
it's the display small have to sell but we're write
and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway I as we've seen the same
Today we have apple juice left we sell all the million of what we have said

the material which we are going to you was for the keys ease up plastic and which

out and also it would be easily fit into a into the hands and you can access all the buttons easy to use
of that you can really hold it in one that you don't need to hands and it's easily
and it's easily reachable even for some of the small
So if you're left-handed a right-handed it doesn't matter

And is to send messages just a tv it would have nine channel
For controlling the programmes the different channels
so if we can start to activate it would take to the previous channel if it is down to two words that like it would be to the next round
If you take the user to the previous the next channel so this
the next channel so this is a Swapping back to
The next channel in a numeric pad or
No stopping is if you're you're watching the sake in china and then you go to the tents china and if you want to go back to the second channel you can start this or yes

So that the question really is how do we feel with the project process so
And then the next question is are we happy with the leadership hope this project

and if you hold it in the centre room and you can you reach it over here so you don't have to turn it a random turn it upside down move it up and down i really
Here is what we looking at satisfaction there are room for creativity
Is there more room for creativity or are we up so we happy
call that it's maybe not in the best position in the room

but anyway what i did it has to have some all symbols text so that people
a and functionality of the last i was because people use it but i paradoxically
and then the functionality you did a really good job on functionality

Now we are ready for the presentation office prototype
and we should so this prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about
and show the prototype you can see research groups we don't

They're scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore
Scroll-wheel no integrated scroll-wheel
integrated scroll-wheel lc display

we had what eight euros twenty as i recall
so there are we happy vs their creativity at has passed a euro war
a euro war we're not happy with a new product we create it all that was created
personally i'm pretty happy

like before we i have to use the meetings from that then the minutes from the last meeting and
R was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface are
And that concludes to presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting
these features into what's that dumps it signal to a meeting signal it's the net or in ed didn't read it now and

And how it works you press about the chip use a morse code be data to read a east be to that generally it to the generator amplification and
She would like to at this whole thing should be pushbuttons was a simple chip
Dna she should be battery should be on a chip should be trendy
electronic simple chip on print is that's what we using
a regular chip on print no
financing was pretty simple

so we have to play with the image play with the snail image
play with the snail image
they don't have a television star they can play with it

Bit of a memory switch a mute but need case the telephone rings us
case uncurved flat it's single curved double curve
where i admit i was little hard on our team here but

the energy source we is say that it's battery right
the kinetic so that's in the energy source that's all we need electronic

Text that we can have on the keys it's a two week that it could
it's a two week that it could be printed on the keys and that's what it is

Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant
and The circuit board is very inexpensive to build an

And this place the menu up on the screen this brings the menu
this brings the menu on the screen and the orange ones

did we knew a tv find new ideas we get

my documents computer buy of
as we know and there's technolo technological world you can do just about anything at any price of the problem was quality so we're just gonna
so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us and

but in my instructions it's a response to go to the border to something no

l all this bearing in mind that right now we are within the budget and

a means we used to use the whiteboard we can use digital pen digital pens
pen digital pens are are these things

technically this thing would also have a sister and a capacitator diode transistor resonator And if possible

If you have such a shame that it'll be silly but Are at the request like that
