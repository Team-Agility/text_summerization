it's a television remote control but
television remote control
but most television remote controls or the other functions as so we can go

I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls but

project aim is to design a new remote control some of the

we're gonna brainstorm about what can borrow a normal remote controls gonna be
but only about your experiences with the remote controls do you have
controls do you have no good experiences with remote controls were put

and then a different remote control with different functions on but from places and half of the functions are remove whatever

the selling price of our remote controls gonna be twenty five euros And our

all the buttons which apply to the text functions in one
or whatever not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control on the button to that to minimise it to this Or whatever are the functions are probably somewhere else we should group

And that is it gonna be a remote control that's what be used for different equipment like your tv and you're on cereal

simple you at the pen function razor function is like
function is like a very simple page application

that the industrial designer will on the working design

the user interface designer or is it the
or is it the user into the user interface the technical
user interface the technical functions design and the management

it consists of the tree levels of design
design we begin with the functional design and we go to the conceptual design and the details assign every level
you will receive an email with the example of a explanation of what particular level of design means to the different functions and only you probably

ideas i if touch the power button
A group buttons all the buttons

controls but if you see elderly people all these buttons and then they buy new tv because the previous one was talking whatever and

and you can make new sheets by but we put the person on the blank button it works like this

worldwide and production cost should be a maximum of twelve euro fifty per remote control So that's

first we're gonna they're gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here so you get acquainted with these and meeting tools we have a smart boards

we have a smart boards that there's those two boards this is
boards this is a presentation boards would do which one am using right now you
Is an explanation of the smart boards as

One is important part for you then recorded course to the user friendly part of it

every level design consist of some individual work and we close it with the meeting you will receive an email

on a blank sheet with different colours with different pen widths i'll

four so you have to think about what equipment you want to we want to manage we did One is important

for television so we probably don't have to have total that's fine just for dvd player or at least

this is a something about the project finds the selling price of

wheels where's the white board i
I we're gonna try out the other twenty white board every participant

euros very ambitious on this one The market

Examples of the tool training project plan discussion and closing we have twenty five

I haven't got a favourite animal to sell all

And it's clear you can put the in the project documents presentations you can all
Project a project documents is for shall not on the whiteboard

And our profit aim is fifty million euros very

no your role of acquainted with the different tools
and then we read through the tool training i

but for you have get the whole quite as part but we will motel are we all know each other names
the Technical part of the process you're gonna look after four so

some of the age i object to started it has to be original trendy and user-friendly
Original trendy and user faye will also already

i was thinking since the tv is mostly used to get the with the vcr or dvd player or recorder and not with a stereo It should be good to include functions for vcr cdv d players recorders
But the edv d players in soon as often double as stereo hi-fi a sense probably swap
special like a pd player inside of it or

welcome to the kickoff meeting i have forget to put
the closing next meeting starts

and you can change the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing a forward but
pressing a forward but you select and format Yes like current colour or a line width
And so in the format menu you can choose the different colours and pen widths

and the management expert of the marketing expert user requirements pitch can that's what we've

every participant should draw its favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics on a blank sheet with

it or then the production cost are gonna be time problem

is but the easiest animal i can't think this is the birds i will
I'll tell us something about the your favourite characteristics of this particular birds

The market range of since national so it's gonna be sold worldwide
As you have to keep it simple to get a whole market it's international so

next meeting starts in thirty minutes individual

and original that it goes hand in and i that something is a regional

saw us all the files smartboards that's all weeks we can do that
are they difficult to understand or Maybe they don't interact with different Like weapons very

so you can you powerpoint presentations on the screen wheels where's the white

i like it's a sharp a razor sharp teeth Plus

there's a docking for cult she to share documents folder you can
documents folder you can upload your or documents to the folder and then you can open over here so you can you powerpoint

but they're we've got a put some net is uses user-friendliness is a bar it priority this case

individual acting so that the industrial

Plus the big for has an small on small actual face and i like it so
You scroll big people sit because of the certainly is

It's important to place your laptop exactly on the marks for the affair
useful and that we want then you're the usability and so that's the gonna be a very important task for you then

Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach i how much

the weight walks or whatever your turn
we can skip back to the goals probably

but we're all familiar with the microsoft powerpoint

this that maybe this some aspect of the or some point it at which we can excel by making a very useful and that we want
