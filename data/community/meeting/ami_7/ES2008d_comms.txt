this middle button it brings up down screen menu and money
and money working on screen menu use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button how to select
But the middle button on the on screen menu function of the power button
the menu select button
But that has a menu button separate from selects button or is this one's the but
or is this one's the but the menu and the select button
The menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing but it's one

we have the on off button at the chip very visible very big We have are
we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off so then we wouldn't
that he wants and you press you testified button
six buttons we have to have sex buttons

And then to choose what colours want to make the buttons and if you
As rubber and special colour a
The buttons and special colour special
special colour special for
but then the buttons will be in special colours
rubber and it's special colour But that's important

and see easily adaptable to either hand you can push the buttons with
you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push
's and we have our little menu button here if you push
if you push it if you're just pushing is normally they're the many buttons if you the volume buttons rather if you press
not unique it's just it's it is just push buttons so that give
And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons or you're constantly push and
Or or like some crazy like a lecture mac but you push it was sent to the tv and stick

which are also gonna be a channel selector s and we have our little menu
buttons rather if you press all at once they become channel changing buttons you
buttons you for breast slept three times in the menu with the other features and power possibly also with your tv channel choices shows up and you have your five
but once a for a changing channels channel
and that it's it's between your favourite channels that you've selected this middle
said like channels or that would be to switch machine off
more three-dimensional you have your channel changing volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle

because older people that are used like texting the thumb might find it a bit at first but
what did we find and new ideas people

the how we work together as a team the digital
different shapes and then discussed of the buttons might work
grey and the optimal buttons work

And people wanna grab hold of that see how it feels
But do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality
remember really we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons that they use
It's very it's very work relevant people that
It was interesting know that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration what was in the remote and that they didn't provide is
And that like people have like things you can put on the keys that you press it and it'll beep that
i would just be attended you make we did a survey this is what people said

No i actually don't have like a power point in time because
it was a little tricky having to hand around this time
it if we're all gonna stay here all the time than having the notes up on the whiteboard what about alright but ever
we did and that's all keeping meetings the time and secondly
the last time we had a lot of information and they're the same time not quite enough
information and last time it was like the opposite had so
i added slides i did a couple slide each time but that's a

because if you're remotes lost it's probably on diversity and in
if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria so
it's probably a little harder than most remotes to learn because
how fashionable can you make a remote it's pretty
I i don't think it's quite as fashionable spiro one remote
Maybe a with a little rubber on we could happen have a remote really and pear whatever he's have a little voice and i am looking at it

What are the ipod you just every time you wanna go back in the menu button again it brings you
button again it brings you back one model
Or two seconds then it brings you back one model
in a word so we're not backed i would just be attended

and we using pushbuttons and with the supplement of an onscreen menu
you put in menus or submenus and so how'd you
and so how'd you get back to the main menu
to learn because you have to use the menu system then you have to

which is in a latex cases win fruity colours that's curved and
curved maybe it's single curved with it
but we have a sample chip single curve
like what's a single curved case how
a single curved case how many colours what the colours
we couldn't answer every single question

Our case material supplements we just
so the case material we just have one colour right
so each unit warm we have one colour on there but the cases
Case material is rubber and it's
if i'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case that if it looks of the case out of college on them up but

so i what we're gonna talk about here it is it just evaluating how we create this project information
create this project information we got a menus how we use that if
The cost than the budget to the project evaluated
the project evaluated those kind a questionnaire

we have our colours not are not text but this is the general
we're corpora wanna know we could also have alternative colours one a more conservative one that's more fruity
Where we we can say we address the wood colour But
if we offer in an in at least three different colour arrangements
I what the set of the basic colours though
really are we just start out by each taking a colour of clay and Just falling around with that i came out

it would make it hard to turn the machine of the time tv off

it on the numbers and a thirteen point three anyway
Twelve point five hey
really interesting and then we have a market for it so if we can produce the twelve point three which we hope
some point but there's the question and then reporters
It's interesting what came out like later like as i was doing them when i was doing a break down the on the agenda that they gave me on that more points came out from your presentation even
The little molds point that we didn't do something for losing the remote because that was kind
the thing as they would provide a an agenda was like several points but
several points but it wouldn't have a side for each point and
point and i still the way i remember that i needed or for that point that i

What about a one pretty hard to mess
pretty hard to mess up

it give it a four tera that's a pretty high learning curve it'll be easy once you've
it's double curved is pretty

No we either plastic is the plastic for the inside it is assumed the
they actually market it to some remote control the company them
i could probably take part a remote control know if i really do too
it all down because it would be relevant by all the different parts of inside a remote control but then
mine it was like would you prefer an lcd screen or multi-function remote control that didn't have like

but maybe were also thinking that you should of middle aged me and customer might not want a free coloured remote so
So like in my opinion but if we're now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i'm gonna
in the middle so i'm gonna say it's like if the rate that's just my opinion

and then i'll talk about the minutes from last meeting what we just discussed the war
those kind a questionnaire and meeting summary
I happens sometimes is that you tend to meetings and then people so just the way were about anything that should be really been decided by thing here we got
by thing here we got it's become clear and the size of points down at the end of the meetings so that
I found that we did that we could've used another five or ten minute And and this in the meetings

and if you wanna play any text on the device like labels on the buttons all the product and name or like a one or whatever
Would it be a very difficult to just have an external device that like
control would with the device like that actually help you to find
find even know this is like your initial i'm initially trying to do just
the up and down buttons are used the scrolling up and down for a list of justice you find the choice

and who are detailed design meeting in pretty excited
pretty excited Let's start

let's do the look-and-feel design presentation first
you hold it you they're like this in your left it or you switch it over
more confusing but if we had all the buttons in black and a designing and the outside and yellow that we're corpora wanna know we
rate and the design it match that appropriate dave remember really we discussed
Sports the user simple and design
but if we're making multiple varieties of this is what i'm getting confused
in that we chief almost all of the design else that we set ourselves And we've come
work and see how we could like improve on the design

and in that case you can't send an infrared think a signal to that to find it

two three buttons for adjusting the volume saved
the volume saved up volume up and volume down on the other side
that was the last one like a chosen not to do a powerpoint saying that they made sense
talking about it but With only for people it doesn't volume make sense
make sense if we had a larger group

you wanna press enter for ten or chart to them
wake it but it's hard to press
you find the choice that he wants and you press

There might be something that you can do in the circuit board in the chip To make it make a noise but it would
it just inspiration about circuit boards
my inspiration from last time as the and interior of remote control being taken up are bit by bit talk about circuit boards i wonder
No have all the circuits and chips and trends partners and i wrote
in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like

shape so that it fits in your hands nicely
It's designs to be used even in your left hand or on your right hand
x wanna see if it has a spongy quality Hand
Hand if it's made of latex the rubber i it's funny otherwise

that if we're able to user creativity with the information
And i felt the first two meanings i was coming in with no information and that sort
Mimi really like i they're in together powerpoint of no information and last
and that they didn't provide is that information to we were going with should discuss that

ri and same scale for functionality is a functional it's
it's functional is also a pretty basic so i'll give it

up with it could stand up like this on your table if you want it to if i made about the bottom flat
have that in between them or you can see a year back and find it but
back and find it but anywhere also it's gonna stand out

to use just say easy to one will be separate sit on
with them here we all need a them separately on the whiteboard in this room
Now when you're creating your prototypes you did you work together or did you like to separate projects

it still little bright to make it hard to lose but
bright it so you read the gonna stick out that
it be harder to break hard to lose
in terms of not losing i do think that on a scale of one to seven and how easy or hard was it two blues i'm

cd screen we don't have a teacher up other than what it looks like
And if it's made of like latex that whole idea that's pretty all
we think that the latex crap appropriately take that into account
get them the homing no idea screen
boating or anything usually like report a good know course idea those are like if we had like a brainstorming period

It sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons including five research and it's
and out and buy and more market research of them and threatened that shortly we could've taken that into account
That's really funny they've got spend in your words you
but ever need sound like specific node
that is in should not our market marketing expert could not agree with the marketing
If you're really doing like of really big market evaluation even just have it one set of source in a word

in terms of making decisions what we need to do is first of all decide on the form which are the three different shapes to wants then
with our the shape he came up with the potato we mango we shape and then

but that the feature that we considered for not getting lost
it does anyone have any other features that they think we're important that we didn't talk about

are you have the on off toggles damn On the top We have the five
The first summit in rio do the job growth i
Where we did a good job of making firm decisions at the end so
i was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we were getting we didn't have enough an information to make firm decisions but we're able
decisive person's the top to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes

in a look at the evaluation criteria look at the finances
and finally it to production evaluation and close
And then finally we have the martian or the pay or way
why don't we do a product evaluation using the criteria if you don't send
make your questionnaire to put down criticisms of But the process on the the final results and

about energy we're gonna use the kinetic battery we want to use
a simple chip because right gonna need a dash of all we can use a
really do your local i have never change the battery
it's kinetic battery that's expensive but we have a sample chip
I i am really into the idea of kinetic batteries know after really about that That's
I could get watches that had like really quite expensive watches that as an ever need a
battery you're always moving your rest

one side then with one being really extremely show And
or a link i what the side of the house as to
sides i would just get slide subtitles on them and

like fancy versus creative it's Different it is
and the next is that the integrate some notion of fruit and vegetable votes I if
son and the user wary net
net i know you're saying you're a little bit nervous about that i it's a remind
Project process That section with the room for creativity leadership teamwork means any new ideas found so i what
But the fruit and vegetables in really good like creativity so
people should really base they're both sort fruits or vegetables
way or a really speaker creative enough to think of toggle switch as in

and we think that each of these are so distinctive that it's not just like another be the technology around your house it's gonna be somewhere
one and an axe if it's technologically innovative
and i'm not good at learning technology for the video
overall we it said before are two main things are simplicity in fashion and so those are the mexicans
it's pretty in technology in fashion to get the real really

which one are we roughly looking at two drafts whether or not it needs rs necessity is yellow we one
like that have been yes and it just been so conscious of like turning the pages are no the bit of a distraction and that was the last one
yellow and blue are the web page
i was just kinda going by the web page they didn't give
page they didn't give me any clue year like yellow grey here
yellow and grey but on the slogan's and blue

i have an excel sheet they were actually gonna calculate the costs
they are the costs under twelve fifty euro
fifty euro it's on to the project

chairs are like they have the option to do that and just take my own notes and whole thing
so i'm not excel at a my favourite programs
how was it only just we're creating from the excel file that was a mike that option to select to some other included so

we didn't address the fact that it does need to have a corporate logo so let's
logo so let's make we keep that in mind that we had that one of our colour just concept is corporate and has the rr on a bunch of our
But all you need to keep in mind your more knowledge management so i'll make you do
a very sad and get me links to the corporate website
what did i get to the corporate website it just inspiration

it's Approximately fifteen fourteen like that
the war have the prototype presentation in
that was one thing that we brought up over email if you picked up your email
i'm also we talked earlier about rsi and windy for and a like carpal tunnel a thing
but it's one of those things that mit t five minutes to figure out but you'll have it afterwards so i
what i sent you the email saying that powerpoint minutes will be complementary rather than like repeating i'm just gonna make i'm making
four minutes so that it will include all the agenda and all that fifteen

phone or you can push somebody or Index finger for other hand or
I don't solve the gatekeeper grip to
grip to it doesn't ring finger the

the digital pens the white
pens the white board
No but the pen was a little distracting for me personally like
Or a tps so It in total deep

The lightning bolt or not very cute
why it just it's like a small but still like queue but dean i

And does it need are like demographic need to for international appeal That whole thing
I'm claiming intellectual property
