i could have a big banana shaped remote control yellow
we can just have a remote control and casings of different shapes different fruit

When we did other remote control market so we found that people will people do have preference for a those fancy more one of the remote control switch look and feel a vote better than having
the second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically a where do we must
do we must have some technology that it was meant in the remote control that other than just putting it as it is as the other or a remote control so it should
they shouldn't be too many buttons on the small remote control which are a bit too complicated
it's a maze to remote controls is graphical interface where you
so for a remote control there is some inconsistency
there is some inconsistency already nick existing in between remote controls by things
when do this is we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls see how they work
So at looking inside a very simple remote control
very cheap remote this remote costs
so this is kind id the bare essentials that we need to have a remote control because
remote control because it defines the
We could make novelty remote controls
as for the energy source almost every remote control is just batteries but we'll

I quite like the shape i quite like the design of that because that could sit
saying that they would need not to do i have a different of a chip more lights everything we just design keyrings fruit shape and

the people tend to recognise shapes to do certain things and
the so whatever people want like if somebody wanted in banana shaped we will put that case we want to that war waveform it

controls by things stand that and shape and up in a in this button buttons like
button buttons like that the top right so on and off people
looks quite space eighty bit too many buttons on that one
seems quite easy to like at the different shapes of the buttons and that's a
so that takes the signals from the buttons in translates into the sequence of courses that it then sends the amplifier which is
and as a clear top and bottom so i you could say transmits from this and
I'm buttons would do we stay different shapes of buttons
for buttons do we want to just have a device that maybe sets and pretend it's a fruit
and if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting are cheapest option of but

maybe just to roll on the fruit and vegetables shape and
it on this so we have to have it clearly identified as a fruit just have that fruit a shape
different fruit shape so in such a way that any giving can you could be fit into this more way to do the so
much of a gimmick that something economically shape and organic like it to hold based on fruits and natural things like that because all already

we have done it is it not only these a remote control market so there but we also considered the greatest threat fashion trends of the market was
so this shit this clearly indicates that preference for the design the outlook of the remote controls so
but they want the choir do they want a fancy look they want some new design something new and
so even if we include either with the rid of it some remotes and we give something new technology got are the ones where and as as new design it fancy outlook we really need the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market

we could make of vegetable you round shape
is somebody wants it there in banana shape realistic banana shaped giving want to that so it will give a banana shape look if somebody wanted
in the shape they will just make it mixed and matched type shape or
you have any that should that engineered so we ended up make it different difficult shape it's for cruelty

odd it's just a rainy how you can have different Different buttons don't feel the

Right a market survey we have seen that people are we doing to be able to but they want the choir
we are marketing to thirty five to thirty five so most people

And That are the most important aspect in the data to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use like a i would
people find that important and it's easy to use
And one of the survey findings was that they want to easy to use a i'm not about the lcd it's quite

it was a good idea because people use mile mice mouse is now with the scrolling thing
You said about the space of all of the people wants baseball things so we could
you just might be a gift that people we wanna grab it can shake it if it's an hour
But where do you think that it will be a good idea to you then i will these table so she was then people
so she was then people have to like in the cell is out of the time i

have to because the you can see how people have a later date clothes shoes and furniture everything that fruit and veggie day was causing the
and the fashion their shows that fruit and veggie there was a people

was we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit
so we should consider this vector is the most important factor of
factor of this vector it is twice as important the second factor which
the second factor which is for that to do is they as important as the side so the third factor so
factor so this vector one of the most important factor in others are in our market means and take in designing our our remote controls

but it may be on the opposite what does it make the on the upper side a
a buttons will be on the upper side or side we will just put a tk half of
be i'm not open or the upper side so
side so from lower you can you mean slide
see it unless you have you got the buttons option on one side you get the fashion on the other side with the microphones so you can place it face time

When we did the fashions this and fashion the holidays and fashion update shows that
And we got some pictures of some a new remote controls to show you that press
show you that press escape f five Or just It's
so like other hand show them so clip-on right

interface where you have cops buttons and you point to it rather than having the output is a stream of text
the user interface the buttons are used to talk about this right

that's that they that's comfortable to hold easy to hold so you don't drop it
We really need really gonna need to hold it if it's gonna be voice recognition
you mean slide you are holding off on the side you can have a banana look all apple look what they were saying that they

the interface specification what people
especially if they want to use it is specifically as voice activated then if it's just

and got an email from our technical department saying that they have broken three would certainly speech recognition software that you can programme and
And the speech recognition setting would actually
setting would actually going for speech recognition a way
And if this you software for the same recognition is that you keep on keep in the microphone
But but the speech thing it doesn't have to be hand held a closed you can set a
so the speech thing you said are take now our research and development department came up with some breakthrough so

are days when those and we can a lady that fruit and veg a day was to be process is that what they were data
So maybe in an unidentified all fruit or five or a fruit or vegetable like
Beep that the fruit bowl
like everybody's got a fruit bowl from the telly
of it at like think of a fruit that could sit and then we and so on like a know an apple

other than just having a functional look and feel good you should have a fancy look and for the feel good the second
beep or a dave and feel of the material is expected to be spongy the other than just having a plastic look a hard look
the spongy not real spongy can
like play-doh latex as a kinda spongy feel do it doesn't
so that's spongy latex rubber everything feel and the colours

so it should be technologically innovative like glow in the dark or speech recognition like that so
what about the glow in the dark think the strip around that we just need that
we've got that technological innovation with the speech recognition system

Don't do it a point to watch tv But if
everything but it's pointing out that this one the volume it is pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape so
charge friends this as good as you pointed out

so since we're going for the but those are the company colours the lemon wasn't that far I have it doesn't work you
if i may not necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company colours so

it will be easy because there will be on lcd c display in the room a different friend i you can just critical whatever the war
a good idea but for but and for the thing we tried before easy to use it's not the thing which before charge friends i

Like a an hour glass half ago so we're thinking
like if this is like if this is a more wider for a banana design caving in such a way like half of what we need not to have a full colour we will just have a half of colour
So you have narrowed it down to half a dozen options
our next meeting in half an hour and what

latex double curved curve
make an oval double curved send it to me if we're talking about three or can we can easy use
so double curved single curved with you

so the method we did the existing designs one of the
we can do something we can designed to share then we can have a public some of the led to probably choose what they want
because that could sit on a say in that and It's quite got a quite a steady pace
look if somebody wanted a nap but if we were designed that even put we report apple-shaped casing on that you do your apple-shaped

a few ideas then that's quite boring shape great looks quite space
But like i have the black and white i it just doesn't like funky and
be a good idea but then they have to keep them and they are more whites outside the solar energy and did a then
we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea they can
just on the basis of like reading room of batteries and that all there is

do you think like rubber would be good odds are really want channel
so for the casing this email i got from our manufacturing team
we have a bunch of options from wood or titanium rubber plastic or not
So the base that plastic initial plastic with a latex can she
like it's gonna be the cover the rubber all the plastic casing and then the buttons and property two different colours or

so that endeared somewhere technological advancement And
although today to be they have got they are going crazy with the lcd technology notes of that you've
and then we'll throw in our new innovations keep rolling budget
now i'm in this very old one so now the new technology this as a man we small and cheap thing to make

or yellow or maybe even just alone italy colour so it doesn't look too childish perhaps
So again like we could have we could quite easily have the main body be different
maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow he would set the logo and the slogan
colours so and all in yellow tend to go to together crs main
together crs main body blue with the yellow logo and Slogan running up one side of it thing

and customers should be provided with the mental state is easy to understand in the local language something so that
and the child friendly at easy to use it
it and that would call significant durability and
And that might be quite durable and easy to talk around

how this trend is going to affect a remarkable attention and how important is it is so we have

So is a standard off the shelf a chip is it
it got a minute standard intuitive
so that not only it doubles as a standard parts and for using it as a recharging of also for using it as send recognition
still ten minutes to get the analyst but so we have rechargeable

so you As much switching over just left of my first two screens that
but the one to lay that it's got like a little scroll function on the side but i presume
but i presume that the functions was come up on the tv screen
And that means you get the bomb that to the tv makers

one or you scroll it and then when you reach the a menu item that you require you pressed the middle of a scroll Right
what about a scroll wheel and speech recognition
what are we the scroll wheel does give ease of use
we can do some user tested scroll-wheels

But price and price not withstanding is it too complicated it's it can be too much just overloaded
And there's a chip roster the ta
roster the ta one eight three five which on their see the input from the buttons and she

the light run x the more features we add
so the more features we had the fancy chips we need to buy input and which adds
and which adds to the cost as we can expect

So can we make them to promote any size we like or is there a minimum or
so if it's not working i people's natural reaction anyways to shake the thing
and work and running out of flying and so
and what i would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay

and we also found that is inconsistent layout which makes it confusing so
of discussion over less anybody's got questions The confusions i'm confused

you open up there's a circuit board inside
that's is the more you move it's got we thing inside it just powers it out

so that could play vd player and it we're handling it so
would be good just you program it like you say you record and then play you and then the court time she and like that so that's
You do have ones like playing could be green or on and off as reds and like that
best way for a specific functions all that in a play stop it got a minute
that's covered up just play just accidentally deleted i was supposed to say next
i hope recover this of accidentally deleted it is Which doesn't

the one thing think about these ones is these secure areas and i've seen a lot of them with the cover missing so like other hand
and parts like even mobile phones whatever have that colour lcd screens it's
like a hand like what it is portable phones thing

they might lead to do it in to find out that and was into the lower than in a way we have done it
reuse that the final essential pieces of it and then
on the board we have to use bc at the same setup processor
processor are more pro use a more advanced processor than i had and find transmitter
and find transmitter a standard

Mail to use the minutes of the last meeting just to save time
and is there any questions you have to rise the last meeting that
in this meeting i'm going to discuss what the trend watching how this
but a warning finish meeting

because our company is very light up there for taking all this concerns into consideration so
Which you can see the little red light bulb at the end and that
and that sends out the infrared lights signal to the television writers
It it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers

you and we have any harm to the environment also because our company
And we're very of rnc trendy company out with so

i like some of these things the raised symbols everything but it's pointing
up as a preference is just a imagination the race symbols
the race symbols little good the lc

I'm not if that at twenty five euros a cat or twelve years fifteen manufacturing course
i'll make is fifty million euros
we're trying to get twenty five thirty five euros want to quite trendy as they said they want

was causing the world is not changing use ten plus organic becoming
rl the data but it is good for have ten which is quite this for the one that we can begin to go
