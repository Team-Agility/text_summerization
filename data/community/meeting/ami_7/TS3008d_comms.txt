That's the look-and-feel would be great on this remote control because
i Remote controls not be how do you feel

it when do it was a remote control where it was useful to have a kind a like power source then it would be this one because it's one
Cheap remote control

a special button when you're talking about at this just a signal

i'm but i'm not that some televisions that we have the remote control supplied as you can do the buttons with a one and a dash into a dash but when you use but the remote control that doesn't support these buttons it still works but
Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or i needed buttons
remote control hasn't got too much redundant or i needed buttons

signal get in when we when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds then the remote control gives a signal for channel one
at this just a signal to see that then they send it signal to the tvt v today have to put a one in a screen and a dash which you can put it so you can are still put another number on that when you
thing that you to the remote control gives it same signal as it would give when you only have
have as a big remote control gives another signal of the five seconds it is just one
No remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds remote
What i said about to the remote control sending another signal that they might not be true but i still
remote control sends one signal at the one button press

the logo is It's It's pretty all the used to see on the remote control what
five seconds remote control is a stupid thing if
I do think that tv support more multiple remote controls
remote control because you always will pick up the remote control in the smallest area then you're
wanna have a car come on Prides remote
Prides remote or it's not hardly a bit weird
a market remote controls
remote controls and it makes stepping easy
remote control in remote controls relevant buttons are prominently feasible
Remote control has got it really trendy look
Remote controls easy to use
The remote control as recognisable corporate image call our logo or slogan
a problem because of it but every don't understand that because imagine a remote control will for more pushbuttons there wouldn't be possible according to do is sheet
I've seen one one remote control with only that but only with a pager place down and volume but
Maybe you can say i the remote page for a job page long
Because of the it could be something dynamic to the remote control
No i don't move my my remote controls are much says like

form we should mark special form thing because it visible
because it visible be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons i
It's still it's a special remote control dunno which is forms special material
we have to think about now is that is still a special remote control but it is

you can when you put a button on it would like one and then a dash it's the same thing as when you just push the one because
and this and when you push the button the remote control gives a single it
a single it in the first place this is signal which it would also sent we put a separate button on it the one with there's that
but a six and then that would appear when you put a separate button for separate button
on that when you don't have a separate button any push you want it's exactly the same thing that you to
Now it's only when you use push buttons it will cost that much if you use

because when we don't need a docking station and probably we also have only we also need a simple chip
Now for for the for the docking station if you'd a if you choose simple chip

It we can make it no big deal but the remote
big deal but the remote control gets why did a state

because we don't have a special functions to use an advanced chip
but of two euros then we have so maybe we have to use the advanced chip in two
That's the question is who would do we need an advanced chip or is it if
i i've got Schematic few of the remote control what nothing about the advanced chips or

No it works if you haven't got special button for a if you push a button then all your television there will be one and align it which is it and displaced
Yes but some all televisions you have to a click on a a special button then you go to a next level you can push two buttons
thing if you push a button it sends it immediately to the television

i kinda miss the docking station
But maybe we can make docking station a bit standard for the other products we sell because real
so maybe we can use a docking station and pretty players or
backwards it's leaning backwards in the docking station
that's at let's talk about the docking station later because maybe
you didn't draw the docking station
but the docking station is you can only got a a problem
but then still when we there's no room for a docking station that
but the problem now is that the There's no such thing as a docking station in this but we can
But we can it sell the remote control and sell the docking station yes
it but what we can say of can Almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station
it but it then the docking station isn't relevant for this project aim or we can
but when we skip when we We we don't use to do now i'm gonna make the docking station then we still we need something else maybe to make it special because that was
We can make a docking station for two thirty
but this year is in the docking station would be a fifth of the price of the remote control
And that my suggestion is just forget about the whole docking station thing in make it
No we have one year at eighty for the whole docking station

remote control has got innovative technology implanted
Innovative in generally or just original four
that's very innovative for a remote control
i would you innovative remote control more
deem them must be innovative technology for remote controls one more in our you controls not in how you finder
that when we a score higher on innovative technology which or two

and then we have to adjust the two buttons we place them in the middle the menu and for the teletext that
Alright and you got a point out which is the volume and button and which is the programme button
And the button for the scart audio video external input
isn't it then we're gonna do the buttons and are we gonna have rubber buttons in there
maybe a two because of the menu button but in that area
buttons you can have four twelve buttons
and was used to that was the mute button and it's will be eighteen
that i don't get one because it would be So relatively so expensive just these small buttons
let's see that we have a button supplements we'll give the buttons

a special we looked at the form material and colour
we'll give the buttons special colour or give them a special
all the special colour things have to be marked v because that's what we were planning to do making it
on this a special colour thing is to be marked
colour at the colours are special the form a special with it this

in this but we can all imagine that would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents
But for two euros and thirty cents we don't get the docking station
We can make a plane docking station for two euros
but we can make a docking station for two euros if you don't put the recharge function in it i

special material also because of rubber
because of rubber buttons have to be rubber

I'm gonna open the specially them all gonna work this out together because
special future i know we will work but

because maybe we have to consider the docking station anyway because we have some cost issues still to come we have to look at the
First of all the all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list

the one because it is first gives you the functionality of that's a separate button all set to apply
that one function and that's in the one button when you wanna find it
more through like function tv functionalities send know
's technical functions

Just the basic idea of all Of the most most Most common a simple operations on the remote
We should know how many Simple chips regular chips
is one chip but which you have to choose one form it
A simple chip busy enough but with
The the email i got said simple chip but when we put in the speaker and the retriever a device it will costa a bit more like a high in the advanced chip maybe
we'll be simple chip and with the retriever it would be an advanced chip
But the what can we do with a simple chip there was different see what the regular chip in a sense
We can use a simple a regular or advanced chip
it'd be a normal simple chip will be

need mb and a lot of remote controls work it when you for you push the one first then you have a couple seconds no i don't
you can we you push the one you can show on the telly it a one and just that there's no way it's it's it's a cat

get it if it's a simple chip then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents

Yes but remote control nowadays are they come with the television or actually the
No it's some television respond differently look
There was some televisions need to be input first nn you

we went for the double curved case
The case a low for a remote control is at least one euro

Is that sense the fifty cents a button
Fifty cents for one single stupid button
i couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents for upper bound really
Twelve euros and fifty cents

because we're gonna use one colour for the plastic ago what colour for the rubber isn't it then we're gonna
in there be a old in the same colour as the rubber on the side
we should use darker colour for the basic and maybe some
No not a different line width of colours maybe
And out of plastic And rubber And with a special colour
Because the buttons will be that will be matching colour between the buttons and a rubber surroundings that's

battery one battery the reason we don't need kinetic
and maybe they like the kinetic thing we could do to do a compromise in which you can kinetic thing
i still also feel this concept making it kinetic
maybe we can do both in the in the remote battery and kinetic
i watch it's a kinetic because you walk all the time

Is necessary when you want to build your company for it to a level higher
when you up whereas one button you give one signal and the older televisions
and the older televisions needs more signals to go level higher

Kinetics aren't and now they only use in watches and that's because you always working
i would like i would've liked the kinetic part as to get some Just to give it some extra special future

When you make the technology that it will give more signals It could work but
no this is very sophisticated than on tv technology when you use of
it then putting technology some is this if it was impossible to To make it happen

They display requires an advanced chip
the pushbutton requires a simple chip but the scroll wheel in it requires you if you vision so we only
as they say is it the only state so the scroll wheel requires regular chip in a the display requires an advanced chip so we don't

I had a code teens and twenties
have i know some remote controls that down at these buttons but you still can know you can still select the twenty a number in the twenty or it's
four five seven nine that fifteen seventeen twenty one twenty four twenty six
You can sell for twenty seven and a half
You you gotta throw us wrote for the room like twenty times an hour really

then you're left of you're right that it's the near the program button
The positive things has to be on the left so i said not oddly instead of lively other
That are some money left to be spent
No no but there's still some concept there's something special left

The power device is very cheap that's just a regular
cheap that's just a regular power cable or whatever

you can access that if i it's a round of my notes i
have to find out maybe you can find it in your right now and we note
with the rubber parts and it's the readiness of thing and then when you move the round a lot then people find the id funny then when i move my remote control rounded
funny for a week i something like that where you have to move it around very frequently used in motivating

because real reaction cells more projects than only remote controls so maybe we can
A solar cells are users
solar cells are also stated
but of a calculator also works on our own solar cells

Fill in the number of components you guys using the five minute of the cost i
if it would cost two euros to have a total thing it would be to we're

Are interface elements are shown in the drawing maybe you can appoint
I would gonna evaluate that design According to a few points
say we gonna give points to to all of these to evaluate that design and
that design and these forget the drawing skills these guys i
in the remote controls got a basic design intended for novas users
Was that the working design or components design
i don't see any possibility to do so because it would wouldn't fit are the final design philosophy but what is there
Because than a whole than i make a part no appeals to me call thinking of our design philosophy with the rubber
it's gonna excel in on the in the range in the field of design and the looks and feel

Will discuss them in usability lab
so maybe a lot of people find it really are doing in other people find a really i i don't
It will be bought by people under the age of forty
In a in comparing with people of data about
Yes too but only ink when you compare it with the elderly
And that's the question is usable it will be bought by people of forty
a rechargeable thing was something to those are you people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore maybe
the targets a group of people said gregory and for all with their remote control has never speaking it
box to do to make people buy it in the

When when the the recharger as a bit but points out we can place all on top of it
and in the middle there's hard to hard material have a hard plastic with a light behind it
Yes we can make also in your lights on the top or the buttons they can make lights on it
Yes maybe we can use on the lights on the side we can use multiple lights so

but it will it will we call a lot of problems The sample sensor
The sample sensor sample speaker what is it is
and what is this sample sensor sample speaker
And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker

that's very difficult because different shapes of devices
let's leave it open for for there's you are because we have to reevaluate anyway it
No they didn't know about retriever or speaker unit
when we don't we leave the retrieve in such a side what that then
with a cable with a buttons on it We do retrieval a device in it

it the components are listed over here the price is given
we indicate amount of components of truth specific point how much we need of them and then
the yellow rose the amount of
It's eighty percent of the price of of the amount of
When you have the same amount of button you have to put it in a carton board and
that would we don't have to do it but what that would just have a lack of key features you have to put something

The display is for some numbers for some text i don't

I've found twelve questions so much but it's still a stand
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen because this
twelve then a bit eighteen i rated there was
They make as much profit as you would twelve and a half production costs

put a when that when it all the lowest part of it so when it's the same as the other products you can put it all on the same
Yes a little lower little a little products go deeper in it

the foley own it's site and the other side is the programs and
Yes on the side that will be a strip of rubber and in the middle
the fronts will give it a more less ugly or side because you can make it in your own yes you can make it in

it was your job in the first me to afford to do your first presentation to make this clear but then you have some time problems but do you think

welcome to the details design meeting
Because i still think that the most important part of these meetings to us
We can do anything else warning finish meeting
warning finish meeting now

it can it has gotta fit into the shape
we gotta fill out a questionnaire to be honest

Then add a discourse now to cr to laugh it's four five
to we're not gonna add a trip to hawaii to

The moment rome reborn right

At the end there's an infrared led
I tend to hear a bell
