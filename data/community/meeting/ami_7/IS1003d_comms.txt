the lemon tv would be pineapple remote control
but now it's the pineapple control remote control it's a pineapple

this remote control is there a prototype
So we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control and it's not
if where we all agree on me for the kick off building of these remote control will evaluate cd in production so
So use the money what's your opinion according to these remote control
I in sit there are a round remote control so ideas
it's a sleeping remote control
but that they would be able to take it in the pockets and being used in the kitchen say i've lost remote control and nobody would take it
So it's so easy to use and powerful as the remote control and has a new one but
Was that a way to create a new remote control
it's party your remote control
One thing i like is the shape because it's not like be on the remote controls can put in your pocket so i'm not in your jacket
I press the lays a remote control No
So we have finished designing and the evaluation of our remote control

you compare with traditional of to do is not controller i
controller it's easier than to do is a comparably to use
that's in the traditional control how to control the scale

and now we have it starts call so we can paint is all that to select channel is quite coming
It is if they say that and a light so that it could be channel three channel four channel five to change
to go to channel twenty so you can say channel twenty one channel four because you really want to go on this channel but if
this channel but if you really want you to do zapping you laundry you want to you kinda and it's just go through all the channels
you if you want to ski from channel one to channel tool you use keep this if you want to from

But that i didn't see where is it to turn off to ten and twelve buttons would like it's maybe
course and from ten to ten channels like you
One to ten to twelve button to thinking in the tv and this

do is a comparably to use for these are countries have to put a button and i don't have to push button you have
to push button you have you just turn the to the ball that to can
So push button and then it's the next day so
push the button this is one integrated

these we call it the martian design it
design it looks like so much room so we call it mushroomed design so this

and that we have integrated scroll-wheel with push the button i
Scroll-wheel with push a button on it

you can see that this shape of the buttons and is mushrooms or

The remote maybe if you have five for pushbuttons so we can do this and i'll try to modify some of them have
the problem with the push pushbutton we'll need

Genetically modified much room i was there but I couldn't speak in
room so we can call our remote control that much room
Final buttons that are it's a room

if you want to obtain the ball is very coming in for you to change the board to change the channel
so you can paint to change the channel
how we treat it easy to turn things to change channels
and you kinda like to add to change a channel

as i said in the first meeting went to have sought a remote control that would cost more than twelve and one fifty euros and it's not it's
or just that's twelve fifty euros So
and the twelve fifty twelve but so far Thirty

The second key features that it's so called channel out so i sent you the traditional
you the traditional key traditional controller use button to select the channel and now we have
the weak point because with the traditional when you just that one menu

it just imagine you have fifty channels that
easy to you can say fifty and fifty it's so

so that's our key features of our pro prototype the first
we had three key use Key points to for this remote control design and
So four point three point five minutes it acceptable

it's not like in a remote from the you have the like lemon senator
it's you have the lemon aspect of this but this is this the case

we have two special colours Pushbutton

Let's go for our detailed design meeting
maybe i will lead to be our two designers talk about some of their us
see i'm this would be the unique design the market so it's a fancy
so it's a fancy design and the unique design
And design you're looking at the chips as a lot of sense and do very informative for us

and the shape there's two basic shape the first
shape the first is the cycle and the second be the triangles these we
I'm not so happy about the fruit shape

but you'd also the leading the but if you do not but if you go nuts all the brought in all the channel you can that's also a button here
this function is just for all brought in from one channel to the next line to make and that's the sunlight

yellow it's our company colour i read

we decided to have something yellow and red for the costs

That is cost to find design
i find it very funny an amazing interesting to goes for the process to from them into that and

Are the basic colour is yellow and red yellow it's
so we used to basic colour yellow and red and the shape
worry and so for an basic or advanced or

by pushing is euro left after the first one

maybe to scroll wheel and we have the colours course to find scroll wheel
integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton so we
So if we have all integrated in the scroll-wheel pushbutton it's

it's true it's wrong we're not under twelve euros and a half
Thirty five euros Twenty-five
we had some problems and we're going to twelve euros and i

colour and And very sophisticated matter so
black then use a regular colour so
To another thing is the logo is missing steven
but the colour colour is what is most important that because i
So we have the logo we have the colour and we have the fashion in electronics so we

senator it is yellow and black The
this is seventy it be yellow lemon

would case uncurved flat single curved double curved
Double curved we can come from the double curved control of saying that from you
Single curve or a single curve

could maybe come up with new tv these factors it's tv so you
tv so you can but it's triangle bit so you the tv you can
Tvs more like fifteen years maybe so
The tv for term and a tv for internet so it's
you told me you do you lost your contrary your tv so that they

you have to integrate the fruit aspect
can see it's every day readable but we integrate
Sarah maybe we can just integrate on the on one side be double r

this fruit and vegetables see what last for ten years and maybe to use is that

It looks like a pineapple the cherry on top of a
But i thing that's Be good to do some more work true is one piece into pineapple if you were
it's a pineapple now it just change it with pineapple or by an apple

we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable by using as
fancy was defined by use fruit and veg it will look
that's interesting you could we could do a fruit collection of an extra mix things electronic device
but just don't just too much the trends this fruit and vegetables

what one of them key point is solar cells
I battery or a solar cells I
but it would be interesting for our marketing team to make a lot of advertisements and sending these solar cells to be

it's a manual when you stop take a way to stop
Then the angle you stop it and all you need the channel you

so as we all agree to accept And the certain conditions the prototype will have a look to final some financial you
We need to calculate them production cost as i said in the first
we have a newly final product

Maybe if you change if you take the bus and salads
but when you're zapping it changing from one child to the other so you're passing through
It and think about tvvs where you can change it's aspect so likes for the cell phones

cannot find it so it's you can put it to the table so we can turns on the board switching to select the channel
doubts as just your training from the base you need to have
base you need to have everything in the hand if you want to turn

i'm not i'm not that's really convinced it's the best way to if you wanna jump from other one to twenty
it's divided by the number by the by history kinda a certain degree so you
so when you say i want to go to channel number twenty that's you decided to go to channel twenty so
Which party them all see president part

like greta in these easy to take me load you can be take them as you can being innovative
Eight floors of luck one yes it's a might be easy is
but it would be technologically innovate innovative so So
I get outside abortion so to see how easy to manage

Single simple chip on print just

And sample sensor sample speaker
We have seen the electronics to from the sample sensor to regular chip all

i read these are the small attractive so we
no maybe improving the text or like having the less small as
this is mike for reading fact that for macrophone
Yellow or when you say technology could be small i know in the core of thing or

We'll have if there is people just presentation by our user interface design a baby jordan And our industrial
Good choices today be jordan
How can we had a project to start presentation would be W haitian so
But it's good to follows of flow and make it now and after is that people can their mind you can't reduce
You customise it ever that so every if people can just sends the appearance you can do
I'm curious to david jordan
It's it's an interesting to just to see if we can If people will buy this one and maybe at some pictures to it have to

it's It's good to To create a conference then of a computer
Suggesting maybe we can create a line of Otv with True

all ball the smaller that so you can't you can't contra scale that's in

so what the inside is is what we talked before about as a cheap user
You said previously that she cares some microphone inside and
There's the technology inside a quick look simple focal comments And you can
roo we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be the main

So has the energy source we have harmed
did you enjoy you or a plane modelling

the third stage very that stable at triangle be as in
in this state that is triangle basis of mars table so
It's the largest a pretty state prisons as entertaining

do you think it wants me it was price increase the price

So i'll still play the role the cedar tree and

so you can capture it's not quite strong different directions
