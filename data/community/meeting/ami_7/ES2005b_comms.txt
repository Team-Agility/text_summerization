other people would require and teletext in a remote teletext option remote control
those people most of teams and people they find that the remote control so for know somewhere in the remote in the home but

And the second thing some some companies that thing that they show them what are more functions of the users in their remote controls but rather than
but rather than those having more functions in their remote controls we should emphasise but actually can do more hard for the operate better than making it too complicated It was
so it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we
And to have any much technical know let's do see at the mall how to operate these remote controls but is it

this way to not only gonna do the cost of all of remote controls but in this what profit also so we have to take
as can see that the remote control have parts and the sports book like that and
and loss and means therefore that they have kept in remote control last time Where do we add
like if they come down speak something of the remote control it applies to something and it glows in the dark about this sectors of
about this sectors of all these points will help them to locate and they have kept this remote control and this are definitely
that and that will activate the remote control starts to be two five
my reaction turn all yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than or so just having

we could do then would be you have a remote control by the tv speaker and i'm
i'm microphone by the tv speaker and transmitter there it sends back to remote you can
That could also be built since the tv there which might make a remote control of the obsolete

if we look at the course whether the consumers they're willing to have pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not we can find that came up to a thirty five years is a joke we have a very good disliking for this this for a blind like for speech recognition in a remote control So we can
Where do we add speech recognition as as the glow in the dark and ball these factors will have the locating the remote control like if they
there was the remote control they cannot to use go they had a some basic speech recognition on it you could program

And what they've got first define that If you a word there were problems they're having the current remote control so available in the market Seventy five percent
Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote control so available in the market are really they're not so
And even the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay a high pay more for this a good-looking remote control so even if they
so there is no fun of having ninety percent but that's making the remote controls to bulky too complicated too expensive and it but i believe that technologies use it only if the consumers they want to use it either
they find that the five percent to thirty four percent of the country where they find too difficult to operate a remote control so it

certainly possible and another thing is about this losing the remote in trying to find it again if you do
you had out more than finding it that was more like in a few watching a fill in the dark you can still see the remote control
this or find the finer things it's could probably make a circuit diagram for that was that

remote controls and we should provide close by problem and no suffice to use also so as that they would go there was could easily lead And
if it if you can build spacecraft you'll have no problem of the remote control

And a novel feature which which is brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection future for when you lose your remote like people
your remote like people microphone on it and any noise

i even in the market for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros which maybe which may
Art look or the market ancient art of how we should design can do other remote controls forty should be there so as to in a house of the profit in have solar cells these

So and as we talk about speech recognition and whistling and
As that this which is on the speech recognition is entirely speech operate user
but since we're cutting edge company we will have alternatives like speech recognition was a recognition and rocket power
Speech recognition potentially flat screen
have the north know products than that you speech recognition whale
that also take set the speech recognition in terms of the interference and not working very and things like that so
And the text to speech recognition she
we're gonna scratch the speech recognition is a bit of a
And it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system like

go out what and actually the eyes was that the This is for a specific television So all the all in one
remote it's only for the television which i'm presuming
television which i'm presuming means is for specific television And then
they mentioned if the television says you're losing two bbc one
to remote you can expect the television manufacturers to put that feature into their tvs
Right and then the remote control know what's been produced by the television

in setting is really very important point it's if we look at the market those people

so i need interface design a user interface
user interface designer i'm concerned
i'm concerned way of What effect be a greater should have on the user and

we have to take care of this vector also like our design should be appropriate should be good looking for the consumers
which maybe which may seem quite high but if i would look so if they do a remote control we design have ago better a better broke read their designs then we can hope that consumers and that for this the remote controls Then
So as the industrial designer my job is to take in input from you guys
so years great schematic that my apprentice designer gave me
to and we want in a company designing remote controls if we cannot they were so
More complicated design that ralph A grudge

The basics that was a basic function send messages to the television set that so people
is right we use the basic functions for a television no
but like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection buttons and

Alright so and so i've ever gonna of gonna go with the idea of And feedback so of remote finder then that kinda that one of them
a bit more durable and that can also be economic and it kinda
and it kinda feels a bit different from a lot of remote controls the rubber

which twenty five to thirty five is the usual
and also the information to rise cases was very useful but what people like what people this like
and what people fashionable because we said people between twenty five and thirty five where the main and by is of rtv so it
and about the functions for tv but as you pointed out people don't actually want that say maybe
about it and what people other people would require

so what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and how it fixed
speak recognition limited buttons organic design

and then as for the user interface it should be trendy
so it appears that the user interface the
the canonical user interface for this to be just a bunch of buttons but
and i see the transmission interface is just an engineering thing i regret that
flat screen interface lcd interface
thing about standard interfaces the people use already windows style dropdown menus or whatever
if you do have a sorta speech interface to it you only need to find it you just say

Then the methodology a doctor to find out of this it was market a detailed
a detailed market survey on consumers was bound to find out that like incentives like kings what the press forward in or breath or what problems they do encounter in all this type of things
it will look at this that how how but the problems of the balloon was are facing the existing remote controls in the market they find

paris only i prefer this one just because it's and it's easy to use it's a bit more
which it does already exist it's not very widely use i don't think easy find a with
easy find a with a whistle functional something over

and you also mentioned that the current products don't always match users operating behaviour by

And f five inescapably a bike and just the and left button for a fancy
of buttons it's hard to tell from here what they're actually do and they really very exciting
As for the user interface problem too many buttons do the one button
We also want to limit the number of buttons so
A number buttons functions and
buttons and if you hit that menu the top you have
So stick that's program ability and for the buttons that we do have

i if you go for a popular shape it working its way around it
it did work for a while though because of this noise reference problem they mentioned if the
something but if you can work around that noise problem

and then have like press the pick want to get on to the big
to use it to leaving remote control to the mail in a big grey
important because tft of just released is it at a remote control for presentations so and a big seven inch big screen anyway so
are we are completely are the box and make this thing a big red ball from ball

It was mostly a telephone that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons so there is
many buttons and as much point out only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons so what we
i should be just like a ten to the price maybe or less an energy

Yes i have to look or are they market potential for this product and make
and this are definitely in-house so much more market sense so we should
no i was going on rafts there marketing research i

you mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people like glow in the dark
we can still use a blue dark as a gimmick essentially and

And it's also the company want to keep its talk to the tv for to keep then the production time
and i jotted down some notes as to what it needs and what kind a novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others
sir told us that Consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products and

just so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe they prefer to find settings that wanna turn on and start blasting
so that that the encoding i'm getting from little bits of what channel and being sent is that they're quite interested in tft display interactive display however that does
you could program it with your channels and then you so like a bbc one and it goes to that channel it
already not i never for bbc too and bbc one or switch the channel for any thing
the remote for to change the channel or to turn the tv on and off you
Smac smells good for channel

electronics so we as the company we want to make a product trendy in fashions a big concern about is

five and i then that most of the users of data more a tv at belong to this age group so
You had a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your tv and
right and so there's lot of this should be watching the tv and then also made it pick up the noise and turn off or in our i'm up but
actually but what about something as bill since the tv that and you can press and i'll send out a little signals you
But then you have like to also a separate module by the tv speaker

and on for some me all i had to work on ones are corporate archives of the great product it maybe for which include
right and having personally worked with all these products i have a great deal of experience with the industrial designer these

e right so more low tech and not too many buttons set appeal
set appeal on to consideration and also

and then what the response p it beeps back at you
and any noise over certain threshold on a topic up as a distress signal on from you and i'll be back and say your hand or this or
that would have to be so specific rather than above a threshold if you had a like a movie on your likely get it beeping back at you
like it takes back the rf The rf remote ideas that

hand that they require of that it's very hard to look at that
we had as listed options we hand

and there's no i've read any research and how many people can whistle on
and the the bells and whistles that we mentioned it take more budgeting more technical expenditure of effort and it's also
and it's also much more likely to not work if we had its bells and whistles
So it a take it your position alloys that's the bells and whistles we gotta come up with a gimmick but not too complicated to make a

to go like the thing about the that's the problem of the tft or the lcd thing is if you're also wanting to
got its do we want to go with a tft idea of the Is that far too expensive i
it's a good chance to the tft screen would break or get damaged the
no it's much cheaper than tft it's just a microphone and some integrated circuits

And Paul in the dark is that with a light inside that or is that go in that are material
and how are you but the corner dark materials are
i know the materials cheap but it's just the go on the dark your needs some like a charger and and then
was up the material is Maybe not this a tail maybe more like this work for a materials to bit more

will say a one to point out there are more said put the fashion in electronics so
so it what they like and what define fashionable and economics
And then instead of colours and colour options they want corporate colour and slogan some higher implemented the new design
And the logo and so the slogan we put fashion in electronics
week as we said colours and fashion were important so
fashion were important so maybe just like little line this around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour

i more realistically then we need a product that's got some kind an ft outer casing cheap plastic
casing cheap plastic
That's as basic are frequency so i'll be cheap

everything all the the corporate website and everything's yellow
go for gonna have the logo on as bright yellow
on as bright yellow logo and our
and also integrating the rabbit integrate the logo and the slogan
i was gonna have to do is gonna be haven't paid yellow form alright
Small logo with the la is more yellow strip forty year low skilled in the logo in it

the budget thing as fifty million euros and
Fifty million dollars a rough
And that's the first in nineteen euro is we've got our we've got make a profit
so when add twelve and a half euros of time

there are much easier thing is just any about noise like clapping shouting
Right and then or do you just subtract a cancellation of the noise we could do
you just shout your command to it do it for you if it's within what i'm hearing range and could be

and are we able to achieve this a net profit or our aims or not Then
but is it also it may be a major factor to load take into consideration when i was a profit sense it's so

And yes that's the that's really this can definitely a pretty in the house or a sales
because it would have really in a house or say that in this a day in this part or age group from fifteen to thirty five and
true safety point of view also we have pretty clear

it may it's from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you how have our
as we have decided in the last meeting that i have to find out so
if you think about this base station so essentially just a lead to have a self connecting break in it so
the meeting so that much to forward on tva
to getting strings of information or try and forward
respect to tell you about the changes before the meeting and then we ended up so

All organic get more organic shape simple device
A organic goal be feeling to it then You may have trouble incorporating screen
anyway and you can have a tremendous of the corner don't feel just as gimmicky
we it was a more organic shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corners of that so that's something good

for which include spacecraft coffee makers and board trains
Or or a high speed train to right and having personally
personal preferences programmable options which just requires more not a memory not have a
We had that it's And to this include teletext because it's become outdated everybody uses the internet anyway can
So is that what about definite requirements that they will that we need to scroll
And what else is a thinking of and then for phone of my head programmable t

cut the classes once i hit this want to use it to

over chargeable stay send because it's a pain when you are not batteries and
an energy source which pride just be your regular batteries
That might cost more like as opposed to with batteries
as opposed to with batteries we don't need to provide all we pride fast batteries but it's more it's that's cheaper to justify battery
no ethics that's gonna cost us money

more hand-held more No i was at computer ian All
hand-held and portable a sportsman it's important because
there's an update but it anyway so your hand held portable and

can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if that already in there as so
easy to ensure document
project documents it's on your desktop as

and practical annotations which i a threat the one
