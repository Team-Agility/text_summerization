do we only have to do the phase one the functional design

At some buttons for the warm all function you already

your video and then the same buttons control your video and

remote working from top to bottom functional design the reduce mean

we're supposed to develop a new remote control that's
But are the basic options for a remote control

like some like some remotes were out there which i know there's one button which is very is to switch between devices so you can

the user interface designer issue that's by the technical functions

can we can interview current users and future use what would you like to see on a new remote control especially for future users

buttons that's just normal buttons has to be a
and for it Teletext You need additional buttons as so

with this industry she can just feel design or shoots could use a working design were correct
I had to foreclose on the working design which is that's that's the apparatus
And use it as the industrial designer can work on the working design etcetera and
i'm gonna work on the concepts actual design already

from marketing perspective function is design phase courses out of the user requirements

it is it gonna be malt media it controls and do we

and we you use button presses to activate or dvx afraid certain functions on the tv and that's

and then use your windows media centre on a tv with the same remote control so with the switch to one single switch

so there are a few means to reach that's by doing research to see what existing products are out in the market what functions
are there any new functions which can be added to our product

the reduce mean individual work here

you have a meeting individual work meeting and at the end of the

that attack the phase of the actor for a specific functions i wasn't

and another function of thing off switch to your media centre because
media centre because that's getting very popular and then use your

but you and you would need several other buttons for a video player you need a play

that this is from your television to your remote control has to be and quite a big case sense

we have first to start the basic functions and
so you have some basic starting point then you can always

really easy to use buttons small parts
buttons small parts of very small buttons that's not

individual work here for meeting to discuss the results that etcetera
you do some individual work you have a meeting individual

we could just are just ascension that's only for tv and video and

design already it's very important to components we want to put in do

therefore we have to do some internet search for what application is do current remote controls support what are feature features of current and future televisions so we can see

control that's both original trendy and user-friendly

that this the user Lyman sparked as to what they

And the marketing expert so it's come up with the user requirements did any

and at the end of the you have to find a meeting and then i

video and we just a possibility to the features so you have

the face but you get the idea it's a cat
and let it work and to get ideas about how have to solar i

winding very fast so but readable
player you need a play and the for fast forward and stop function

points it use infrared light to communicate a signal to the tv apparatus or stereo

Move to the meeting room i

do have to explain know why it shows is is animal

and you should draw an animal A sheep explain this different colours and if different i would change
if different i would change that explain why you drop that to take your animal so

we have a financial aspect to this project
we discussed and put it in the project folder

because sell them at twenty five euros up
The aim is to reach sell as much as fifty million euros that's quite a

And the production costs should be the half of the selling price

this opening acquaintance Tool training how to use the things here project plan discussion and that than the rest of the meeting

and for the changing all to that all the channels and changing the volume

And at the end of today we should have a prototype for not

Is this part of our a quiet or introduction to each other

steps and then every step i have that's specific tasks to perform whatever that to
