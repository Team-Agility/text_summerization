you count Leave out the number buttons i
i was thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button
Don't you think you can if we can count this as as one button an integrated the these buttons in three Then it's a lot
Or we can leave out the ten buttons and
Remote with the with respect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one two zero

Then there's the Zero to one to zero buttons a button for teletext a button for the subtitles and the company logo
the on off button it's a necessity you can drop
we have to skip the subtitle a button

Then there's the volume and channel selector
the volume and channel buttons you need you need to go to those
And a shame you turn the volume and channel thing is for two buttons each right
so maybe we can even make one button but the volume and the channel in one or by pressing
So we might want from volume one for channel Those scroll
So if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on off button screen right be a hundred and then the scroll button

the default spot for the on off button and the mute button
and the mute button just below that Then there's the volume
The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice so we could
Or or you can build and when you press that one button
building correctly so this is greg mean if you see something wrong I
we can this card to help and the mute button by pressing down volume long or pressing down a number Long that say this is
And just If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll wheel

Yes just a normal just as the normal remote control so so
You post it or you can and page one on that you can use the normal want to zero buttons and
It's normal plain buttons

on it but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people
a radio button is not exactly what older people expect of a remote control

if you scroll you'll see the numbers on the lcd display until you've
so if you scroll to a number and then you a second then it's good to answer that channel

when you're in teletext are using your buttons where you just press it then you go to the next teletext page
used can't integrate that teletext and a subtitles in one button
it's the teletext subtitles or right now you just push
right now you just push the teletext button go to page
go to page eighty eight and teletext
But if you push the teletext button twice

and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers
That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheels so Integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton but
What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight hundred eighty eight
that could be just the like the scroll to eight click scroll to eight click
would turn what a scroll wheel is
It only five buttons on it And the scroll wheel
if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guide you can explain to people are to use the scroll-wheel
screen which can provide extra information how to use a scroll-wheel how to use the other but buttons as subtitles
It's pretty big scroll wheel
hell functions will be good if we have scroll bar scroll button will be necessary

Because then we save ten buttons then we have
you can save a euro by a flat design
That would save two buttons if you do the same for the channel
She cushions Internet access
should save it an put it on the internet or a and she writes for the for us your directory so

you can also used but on the four changing the the channel that So so the shifting button for shift shifting up and and take a teletext and shifts in and out
But they know the scroll buttons from an old lady also a they call
also a they call also buttons like that's for changing a chance so
You can you can change market somewhere by changing the front cover that's one thing you can

if you hold it and you press another button d help goes to the lcd screen
a it's a lot of money we can keep a lcd screen which can provide
But we can and keep the single curved one just to Express our lcd screen a bit more So people

Simple plus minus button we fought
we fought of a help button if you hold it
So stroller simple prototype And we have to
I still then a few meetings earlier we and try to give it a simple just a few buttons and large buttons but
minus one Minus three Minus four

Also the lc display it's too expensive for the display we use they
If we leave out to display we can also save money on the chip
It is if you leave out the lc display And if you use less buttons So you can take the single chip

if you just make control for just a tv there's just not much to gain here
And we gonna buy a a remote control when you can use it so
But actually becoming a choice between like I we're good Remote higher production costs are just Any other remote control
and do we Take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control like it getting lost and Yes i Inferences think we do

right but what's the e big advantage of our remote then
easy maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little especially since
That you can make quite a big remote control for just the same price as a small one just you
board Just to have eighteen dollars a remote
is remote fancy shape look and feel enough to
The target group is the remote really for the group we're making it for And

But first People do the To prototype presentation so
But then again that would be that was just trouble option for older people would
if older people like familiar forms and familiar this
But if you want to share of when you make a a picture like this one the presentation it's easier to share it with other people so you can
push it in america people are pretty take it then Sometime
mean if we didn't go make a scroll button anyway It be more for the younger people are for the older people So maybe it's
Or specifically for younger people
so you can also try to ritzy younger people but putting fancy covers on the market Just as a test cr it works that's
then it would be way more popular with younger people are those that would be with Older people Even if it were there covers

but then the biggest costs are the buttons
So maybe we really should try to This card some buttons to keep our costs low because you have to
Beam he must Stay below t low self a fifty or
the production costs within the pre set limits they
So that shouldn't be the biggest problem because it's very cheap

Which isn't it the docking station isn't even in the scripts schematic
so with rlc d screen docking station scroll buttons
so i've got twenty cents for a docking station
but maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a bit higher

we can see that the difference between and curves in the single curved is one euro
know but the single curved is good for the design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control we have to
just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved
think single curved it's really easy to just fill in and
and single curved you have to have a different machine and a flat one
does everybody think about the flat or a single curved design Fake
i still think we should go for a single curve design but then again

Sound for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons we have a different colour then the case so they
Then we have to case material supplements it's plastic as
If we Leave out all those buttons press you can go with a flat it's flat case and
and we have the removable front cases so

But because we have the advanced chip You can just count
And the regular chip is not possible has to be advanced
If you want to use an lcd screen you need an advanced chip

money and the more functions you wanna have to more money is a cost so we have
It's just a moment or we ask our can ask question about the functionality
So people will use it more and specially for the hell functions will
are they're not too many functions amount of functions and i'd get

this the design detail design meeting we'll discuss the look and feel of the design the usability interface design and
it was better to have this price this the earlier before went on to that For the whole design
so that's which are still a study analysis of the requirements we set up earlier
It's a design fancy on a scale of one to seven
Does the design fit the group focus
Ink we should have should have the finance thing you have thought earlier In the design phase
Teamwork didn't work out working together also you to review at the last phase

is our last meeting And this meeting we'll discuss
this meeting we'll discuss our final design and we'll
hard because the minutes of our last meeting We're not here
satisfaction was a room for creativity
you'll get a christian in your room And then meet
And then meet you in think about ten minutes

is a cost so we have to see if it fits within that twelve and a half euro per remote
so we will we finished other half past three But first
tell you Those are going to have Pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half euros
because you have to No have to get the twelve and a half euros at the end
is but then it seems to me that is impossible to get at twelve and a half euros Also the lc
Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million was it
Fifteen fifteen million we will

option so it just put in put a person the banana
since market research Indicator the older people Spend their money easier more easy maybe it's
Or do some market research and see what the options are
this all really require a lot of marketing To get this to sell

and we'll do some evaluation about the No low need a product that also the project and there
and there are going to a close the project today as So
are questions about the project or but the product
And then i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation Summary of the project

then we also that some evaluation week or criteria and then to
i like Set up all these criteria And evaluation of the Thingy
That brings us to the project evaluation

but they're supposed to be equal size round we've up with a little logo on it for them for the volume the triangle one just for recognition
And recording ability If our company as if it is easily recognisable their company made it
Is a country company recognisable we have the logo
And they wanna put fashion in their products in the slogan of the company and we have the

That's possible This time of day starts at three
and the closing off so that they've got forty minutes
the learnability is very important factor here it's
these are seven factors time seven is forty Something to

them because we only have thirty minutes left I'll move on
I'll move on to the finance part which
sit down and think we still fifty minutes left so
left so the master schedule
did we move through the right faces you think a long process

it's rather hard to draw on the whiteboard but they're
My mother can't even send them as a mess message
the smartboard the drawing is just a pain in the us but
Smartboard files irritating
i try to open the file on my laptop but
Hey need to the smartboards the application

it does because my pen filter applaud his data And try to
but it's it's giving errors but that adding the software
in the us but The digital the digital pen is very
Hopefully my pen of download this software Or data

structured so you can just to step by step and
step by step and it's very easy
