Experience with remote control first ideas Your remote so
so i may be found was a remote controls buttons a little small like we have
know you have to get a sense to pick up the remote so
the remote so we just in the design a remote control itself or

check but it's just a television remote because
is the stars television remote controls may wish
Television remote control

so we have the project in which is to to come up with a new remote control device
And Or idea is to To make a new remote control device so more user friendly than the previous one and two

We have starting this was the original Which is been in existence know for a period of time And
to me sensible it as you already said Another more annoying than having three or four devices whatever they by the time and
so the same time you want as you rightly say one remote for all

We all clear what object is willing to me to the next thirty minutes and i i'll
I'm not it's not clear on what we design a new remote is if someone

are the user interface designer
problems you designers america but what i
i'm not actually had too many pets a problem i had time

In each of these feasible You should be handing over to your cells the design is of those This device and they're having
you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more used to using remotes there for the moral
We've done some research about what the cutting edge hand held devices all and a

remote so i we were looking at what is special this point trying to help
point trying to help you to you folks designing our new model as a where so
That's true it during the course of or do we might make decisions based on information on meetings that would change Where we're going but at this point

whereas if you a fresh you just gonna put the food and a daughter feed which feeds them over the a couple weeks your way and
and Sometimes the weights of remote controls to feed them but this because

The method of doing this is split up as you can see into The functional design you conceptional design and detailed design so
it's still we've got the working design For ide du
ide dui d the technical functions design marketing

And so if easy to use the buttons access for
exclusive you can't have bought the one device and then have few buttons on it too you want

Are we We have twenty five minutes for this meeting we
and they're having meetings so that we can during the course of today and come up with Better better and implement we had before on there for
we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting so
Next meeting in thirty minutes
and i i'll try and write up some minutes of the this meeting to to get you for So next meeting

As you can see that my are just have to stick work as useless as anyway
controls may wish to stick to that and as we get told otherwise

They week and then have that instructions with the remote so we just
marketing a user requirement specification specific instructions
specific instructions sent to you by your personal and by your personal coach So

but this because you're set in a chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room so
the room so it was in the past a difficult to change the channel know you have to

No no you're you're move out from the microphone and the camera together
that we need to maybe think about how to we could maybe a developer of the control which moves around i don't
so move the part i will stay

affectionate some people don't but i know very affectionate
things we found in the market research is that people have to get confused by the number of buttons on them as this

That's that's maybe something for the future in talk to television but
it is possible that we could devise a system where you're holding a major computer which is controlling only all your view or television in your stereo and where you

So what we're looking to sell internationally not just in europe or looking
And so the penny what the the overhead costs are all the time and How many units we're to sell or projecting to sell this point time So

because a lot of Systems the tv video combine know a tvd v
a tvd vd combine
d combine all of the most annoying things as having like five year olds in the house so if you got combine
so if you got combine system it could be a combine true

Work has been on This project for by the Twenty five euros is the expected to a someplace affirmation has come
or looking at Having a production costs limited to at twelve and a half euro per unit And therefore making a

We've got more time to prepare over the sides of all stuck or
of all stuck or bits and pieces that but it's

had time To be honest with you where i'm not too keen on them anyway not to worry so what
not to worry so what my boss is a got a moment is they've got to a few fish and so hopefully

The lime and that's nothing like that because and As a maybe the same any cartoon characters may the past but like
where we can make something we have Easy to press past as the main function

so does anyone have any thoughts Has to the tool training that to is required

at the very intelligent compared to dogs maybe
can make a roof that was similar to draw
i'm gonna go for the dog i'm gonna draw one partly

if you grab the a slide to the left to pull it out
i will stay here and break off I'm not the minutes

but like jungle could write this like that correct

You just click return it should be get rid of a message
If you hit it is it an issue get rid of a message

Right so everyone's to supposedly until the favourite animal over on the whiteboard over there i this is
because with most of the animals if you're gonna win holiday or whatever you later Spend money or get a friend or whatever to look at software whereas if you
