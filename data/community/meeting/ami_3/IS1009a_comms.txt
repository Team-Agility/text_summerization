here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve
the working design i that's the function id
working design it's out mainly technical functional design
so we you're working design and then it functional design and the

so we are looking for working design when we come back
so you are the working design so we you're working

and my role is to design a television remote control
be this thing we are wanna design as a new remote control and two people
F to finish the remote control get to that
Now the discussion i it is does any one of you would have experiences with remote control
loses remote control
Now having using a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with its things you would like to change things would like to improve with this thing any

the same goes for the conceptual design they will be individual

Read different types of design we can be concerned

That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what we have come up with the same goes
they will be individual work week and then discussion afterwards

and i and and user interface my role is
the main responsibilities user interface and my
and the specifications of user interface and it in but user interface design

jan to be my oldest industrial designer and my responsibilities

and my responsibilities are drop r or a deal but a lot technical functional designs and the specifications
And then the technical functions you'd the technical function so you are

has to control the favourite animal does anyway

Yes i feel that all the remote should be very come back to that those

and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirements specification like friendliness

the next meeting will be in thirty minutes you all

like friendliness and what we just discussed and channel that would be you were

like that the remote control which we use for tv it should it it should be used for for some of the pope was also like controlling the can't reach it inside that house on fire at condition us for heating system
and they are some either phone rings and they want to turn the tv or forensic least i my remote control

So it should be a multifunctional a gadget do that with the control your house old machines

my role is the main responsibilities

The market range unlimited meeting international

Yes opening acquaintance tool training
Then tool training try at the white board has to control

have more buttons on a at or maybe clearly better market buttons things like that

so that it's in case we have two in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard
it's a case we use and reuse them right every day and
it is more like a on top of your book casing use like at that all the coffee table

and worries or clapping that's not specific enough
And piece that you will get specific key instructions for that that's the end of the

and betsy i'm the project manager for ti so when we look at

and two people original trendy and user friendly
because one of the big things that happens is people use them they can't find it

If lost a signal was a bit slow signal no
as i say i'm just saying the slow signal meeting just whether it's a beep or whether ally it store
So let's answer would activate the signal

or or if it's really a dark spot that it gives out the a salad or signal but
my idea is maybe that's the main it really hit me in other words if it's like in a dark spot it mean you're like a newspaper is on top a sweater is on top or it's a bit behind the plant at that moment it's like it's like but you call it the lights at the sensors in
know in that nobody has a sensor it gets a certain darkness it has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep

and we'll take to from their project plan that falls
project plan that falls and at the same heading

I do think a good clue for that is that you would respond to a clap or a response to your voice or would respond what you'd you have to do to make it beep or blink

selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro
that they did that the price is a good price the price
We have to justify that was by having sufficient features to make it so that price

Our profit aim for the company is fifty million euro The market
And the production cost should not icsi hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro
A town twelve fifty euros per

to move a lot but we have some good points to start with here
minutes any questions at this point four

to materials cost etcetera

hm that should keep everybody on their toes and challenge

right no like teeny shape for a spare in your hand up

See if i remember have to draw kitty cat or a rabbit
