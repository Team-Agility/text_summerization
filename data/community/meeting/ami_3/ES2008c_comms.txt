box is where you press buttons and it comes up with the
be harder press a button
when you when user remotes you press the buttons where you're from you
one and when you press the buttons are fun
what i'm pressing buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press
hand and you press the buttons are fun and
And you press the centre button that's your all

for buttons we have push buttons which is
push buttons which is what real reaction uses the most often but we also
which can have integrated push buttons or we could go all
so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery or
probably push buttons but i'm it intrigued
also considering that research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data and
And if we wanna keep a cost we should just go for push buttons then
so in terms of economics it's probably better to push buttons

we don't want lots of buttons complicated features we want something
It's very quick to access the main features are you can just about
and see you use the buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features you want something
So i like like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often so you'd needs
and that would allow you to access the advanced features are was
are was keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for all the features that you use most of them

and the button to switch off in case you get bored
that's your all purpose select a button right there
so few buttons remain things but then i go back
And otherwise no matter how many buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting on that though it's gonna
depending them a week at a buttons and for later
i assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons we can use

if there's an onscreen menu of your channel traces then you can scroll down on the scrolling
When you get on the on screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
And if we have a skin on screen thing you could scroll through like you can use your buttons to scroll through things that
for channel surfing a scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast I
so we're doing it on screen menu then we can scroll through

and one of the suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
I do think that one of the important features for a remote is seen a menu and seeing what's on
we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the vcr i've understood you could rather than menu as what's on
So we have like a menu button so that we can access on

the know how to make a decision on the remote control concepts
a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of
a whole the main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as or the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery these are all things that we
because how often are you that your remote control get a certain amount of a light But
we want people to be able to use it as a remote control so we need
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the television be control for your remote control
it's something to bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control communication is one way
one way you can't have the television send information back to the remote control list i don't think i'm not
summary that was market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted and then also
So first they had people they blinked on the important aspects of a remote control and right
so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
peeler in the remote control so

so you'd needs a few buttons to select your favourite channels most
so you have buttons for your favourite channel changing the volume
Like favourite channels is applicable but you do
When it may be good for us is like you could have the same we'll fact for like channel flipping and then the other white could be like for but like
the volume how useful be for changing the channel you don't have
you really need buttons changing the channel
But if you could scroll through the channels and the volume would just be
And the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker looking And otherwise
On off volume favourite channels and the menu
of button but the volume control could double for that

but i'm it intrigued by the idea of the scroll wheel if anyone has anything
i know the ipods and things right now have touch scroll buttons which are exactly
or it and use my thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll wheel
in an lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
simply it's cheaper to make pushbuttons and it is a scroll button so in terms of
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton but it's gonna
you can just hold it down when you get a one liner scrolling through

circuit board and chip we can have a simple one a regular one or an advanced one depending on what are
to replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work that
but we also wanna go for a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs
down we're only need a regular or advanced chip if we're gonna start using an lcd so we want
but i maybe if we decided on like a simple a regular or advanced chip maybe
if we're gonna have pushbuttons the require a simple chip but
a simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip in an lc
so we could either go with a simple a regular chip depending them a
on a chip let's go with the simple chip

high-tech in have an llc d screen
ri uses for buttons to me to move around so range of settings so on a small lcd screen
then if you want to do anything more advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen and
the lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
also you would be looking down at the lcd screen then back up at your tv and people

if you're watching tv in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons which are not
most people when i watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv and watch
which is something you do all the time when you're watching tv and the button to switch
other features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv
it it to be tend to watch tv in the dark but
as if you've got a small tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text comes up
i if we would one on the screen there are on the actual tv i
tv i them wanting to say on the tv
on the tv if you're changing the brightness on trying to see it happening and

but we also have these options of using the kinetic battery like
kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches where you just have
and i'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery solar i don't think would
But this idea of the kinetic that you don't have to replace and
I'm assuming That's a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
what do people think about this kinetic battery idea
it may be better to put our money into the like the kinetic battery in the cold case

we do they have a small lcd display on the device itself or
and the advantages and disadvantages if you have an lcd display
and an lcd display would have to be quite small
the dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display

and we can make our case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic but we have
the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons it's very
are you can just about make up to our that it's the bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main
that the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
it doesn't hurt you say have one time i am imagining
couple main ones being like and lemons or stripe there have been

it you have any ideas had it possibly use these and how to use a fruit or vegetable or or the spongy material think
Could we go in fruit and vegetable colours we could colour currently
I It is it's best to be shaped like a vegetable or like i don't like a carrot source
Maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits
I see like a round remote instead of like a rubber button down one like in terms of holding it like that so if she to a fruit
I may be want something that's shaped like a mobile phone so you hold it in
Good Could we can we have changeable covers like for your mobile in different fruit and vegetable colours
Any more information on fruits and vegetables have to haul
and probably in colours maybe free vegetable colours

we can do there's a shape of a case we could do a flat which flat case the curved case or it maybe even a double curved case haven't
so if we're going for fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements maybe
It's double curved like would that be like two hands time
Some imagining like double curved is like like two sides that curve gonna
that curve gonna make one curve would just be like a single word looking thing but i have no idea
I know if we do have a double curved case it can have any titanium in it

there's no point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
or a have a just a menu display that comes up on the television and
because it's it lets you just sit there and stand control the television from your armchair

we've also got a member of that this is the device itself is useful purpose we
and make that we include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end
and that we actually end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
but essentially we need to choose how is this device going to work how
what model is a going to be for user interaction with this device one
simple device this is an ipod from apple
up on the television and be controlled through the device and that would allow
and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay a get

know were concepts of user interface
And sent and that is gonna be the concept of the user interface list of device
we've talked about it's a bit too essential properties of the user interface we wanted to be
when we going to be the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface we have to decide on whether i have a scroll or not
interface and we'll come back to the chip i suppose
the interface the tape and the supplements
a radio tapes or is the duration

that in mind that these are the options that we have for manufacturing and we can make our
and then the battery is worse things get most exciting were talking about long
we can have your basic double a batteries but we also
solar battery although there are slight complications with solar battery says and
with solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
they only described as the type of battery you find in porches from about fifty years ago flashlights not quite what that is
that i receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
to sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
that would Probably take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries

make a spongy remote would be easier on the hands
but it's covered with the latex it's a spongy
latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
and they pick a first could be spongy latex where but the
i'm kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end thing

we sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford it would because we have
international be on we said but for all age groups different functions of it objectives were
a specific functions to keep the remote from getting lost a large buttons for the essential functions a possibility for extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
so we need to determine what the essential functions of the device r and make
making that we get all the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features and
but you do need to have some function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description of like i
and right now it that they're saying that currently there is a functional look and feel preference but that

so conceptual design meeting and it's sending
and it's sending it out's only fourteen twenty five and
armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
i a lot of fun doing it components design
so we need to examine each element separately but we're designing
it's very minimalist taken this design ri uses
minutes a new type things you look and feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work together

concepts panel close
We have the number of different choices for a design concept and start
and start something that or show you some examples of
one switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts making that we
presentation i have one more slide before we close but in that side
that though it's gonna know really start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked up

i have considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information
that given the list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery but
i got a bunch of information on how should report are produced there are

hit my understanding of old latex cases that it's hard to protect inside but it's covered with the
what i've seen just not related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard plastic inside it just cover with the latex not too fickle
not too fickle a or latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard

that like to do it in this order first to the conceptual specification of components properties and materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
some word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials that what
a broken question on the weight of these different elements have
but if anyone has a specific question some has to email me
i'll be more specifically digital box
think i'm envisioning more like the material like you have when you said megabytes of also it doesn't hurt
a get specific instructions from your personal coach

twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again i'm so
a minute or if you the minutes of the last meeting then we'll have your
we have with fifty minutes left so
We have five minutes left of the meeting so
our next meeting starts in thirty minutes a new

I've saved it this in the shared project so if anyone wants to look and i have
would have to find a way to protect like the chip now i
about it because i'm worried about protecting on the inside
i don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board that's

preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes that just
they're mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel and
look and feel and as these are range the top one is double important to the second one which

mean objectives were simplicity and fashion and
be plastic but we have all these fashion in technological elements we can add in the word latex titanium or rubber or other coloured types of plastic
here's what we've been talking about all through fashion and simplicity so if we're going for fashion
and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan comments on some things that are gonna be go on this year So first
The whole designer of our real reaction company wind focus on fashion and
even know were stressing more talking we then talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine has
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and just technology you eat it easy to use is necessarily the right drinking personally
reverse it but if we're working this company that i there are what we have to stress fashion the most but
It's there's something to be said we got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to Are are repetitive stress injury is and things and

But the titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used
hard to us as being used in the space program so that
I know of moving on to market Acting
Even though this coming from as as trendwatch market research i don't
They have to attend a certain amount of space and
i would be more with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone thing

the components concept of energy Chip on print
there are there certain fibreglass with copper wires and shown to them and
and that they're quite easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print
which chip-on-print as that machine prince on the wires and source it all together for us i don't really know
i got simple regular advanced chip-on-print the chip-on-print
chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor so we do not about

opening armed bizarre
and the packaging it's like the po so instead of opening
