that the main idea of the whole thing is to say use you just press buttons and it should activate things on the tv and we
which has these context of really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button and it'll connect the circuit and
used i was thinking about that was sometimes when you have these things it got little lights on a high the buttons so you can see wall the buttons are like a mobile
buttons and also like five or ten seconds and not being used i have that and off if
that and off if we decide to skate for buttons it could light up
made of rubber plot was thinking more of the buttons because
the buttons because the buttons which the set
the second option and they'll for rubber buttons but
what all we could have rubber buttons which are made of this to tear which is anti rsr
The traditional certain but buttons which are already explain example

we have a couple of changes in our plans and that's you can use teletext it wasn't gonna be control for everything
am we decided on the most important aspect it required to the remote control device will come to that
they also what a remote control to be technologically innovative
so should we be thinking of using something like that in a remote control to find see
three five which is was used in every remote control it sends out standard signals based on your input and the
To turn a battle for control of the controls
it's a remote control you were saying watching tv you are you gonna want to set of open and say it's a good habit sharing that you are here for everybody
of that the only common feature is that the channel control and volume control rest
volume control rest other buttons there in a very disorganised and they
which are already explain example the volume and channel control buttons on
because it this is the most guns is something in all remote controls
because that would be are not addressed the issue of for how to locate the remote control if it's lost

people want it's like a wind-up or a da so you wind up you're
there but not many you don't want to let me mark people who live
mark people who live in basements that's just not that many people but there are people
people most people so i watch tv in the night anyway
and the kinetic is something people don't do wood
is it possible just as an option when we open up people can use their fingers to press the button or we have inside like a small pointer thing people want to
thing that we should talk about people for location we just rejected and

with the size on the being a flip design and
be like because we really big into that region size also so
size also so maybe it's standard people they might take this a space one
we what size to stick them in varying
to stick them in varying sizes or is it just one size or we would have to fit the design of
like that the it's simply space like that so you can have the than the size of the non buttons and if you v
just came back to the interface size of the buttons be

where is if you come to plastic they can be a little more they can do use of curved shapes
i'm just wondering if we make the basic mold out of plastic that have like a rubber cover that goes over the look at the spongy feel
So instead of the fashion or comes off being plastic the fashion that comes off with the rubber like this hand
The rubber sleep on my list
to be decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell variety of designs
going to be this image of all in my head if something shape like that maybe about that size made of plastic fits into the palm of a hard rubber eyes cover the spongy is that really going
not we have to plastic outside case just a rubber thing because in some
were fruit and vegetable colours the rubber cover the case itself is plastic so

Right and this is our conceptual design meeting
this is all about the design of the edge components and the
So that affects the exterior design
strong but it should be left factor of design rather than for
a applies to both are designers here it's not how it fits and if we flip open
be just at the input from the previous meeting especially from the marketing an industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility think
so you generally see you rectangular shape very monotonous designs you
For the border design plastic
and rubber as a adding on for the grip something like to add to the design
to produce the if they used time we be get feedback from the design fear switch to something else is coming in it so we easy to first is to produce that they can be slipped on which is not the
it should be more read it but the design is that you can change it every time

may charging that what do this early to be honest people want it's
today to charge us to the day and then you've got to charge just for the evening
anyway very the kinetic charging which is like you get in where you get in greece watches and
form of a it's a small a cell which it charges and say and the side the size of a watch i watch battery they use
referring back to so the charging is that compatible with a standard battery so we could people put
you if you had something to using the standard Batteries and to sell a charging
one of the decisions we have to make is whether we had a clear tripoli but just it's about to be charged
of the decisions that we've made tennessee charging to watch tight batteries and

v and we discussed last meeting there should be easy to find also
findings ago when i stop it to our this
and that then gets translates by the chip into account and then it's find
account and then it's find out of this led a in the sequence of log on and off busts
are like a mobile find that the more often an hour Than on a tv remote but you could
you would oppose the mostly just channels or your phone or does the user put it a function very often you find it very irritating to use of And
So the findings are too many cluttered buttons
it's we'll find out more about cost afterwards rights

a like the end like marketing team say do people need trendy they'll board of back and like so you

and the a it's a useful old tv remote so the moment
this always you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be a big but
wouldn't be a big but if remotes away is good for a round and so
with the thing about it is That they can be as big or small as you want today because you
so you take as a bachelors remote should be in a stamp a nightclub on not being used i was
so it could be like a where is the remote and the double counts as i am here Some thing that
at those remotes they are anonymous very similar looking things this

a line that we were planning to do some soft touch screen No
but that an lcd type of screen because one
to vary you can have them in us all of our brain you could a range the buttons on the screen in that solves that thing and you could have to like attach
on the lcd screen you could you bake it you could fit the problem
fit the problem with it is that it's flat and so you can't be lots of could have things with that but
to interrupt but it's quite a curved thing is a problem with me
You could have a flat screen inside but
but just wondering whether we want an lcd screen inside a wouldn't be thoughtful
If he'd if you have five buttons that they're on the screen and this lcd screen
we've got the flip screen the top one is gonna be the lcd in the palm one that's gonna be the rubber or less buttons

and second question is like a mobile you can change the colour of your colour the skin or the
your colour the skin or the wheel so in
colours and it's a used just by charging that you think or it makes connection
but we can take inspiration from fruit colours like the vibrant colours or red chili
That's the it's not as expensive as a would be if it was full colour if it is called black one mean they use mean
always rubber i suppose spongy apart from that we're just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours are not
and fruit colours are not gonna try make actually a vegetable for a design or anything else shall we discussed just go for the colours

type thing and very expensive just a process
Quite the squashy design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case if you gave type
if you gave type thing in making a do a standard box shape where is if you come
type thing and it's just a would be so expensive to buy new case for it because of the expense of how much that aim is to like in
thing regarding the circuit since we had any having a flip flop we can customise that too so case would different type of buttons like a keeping
type of buttons like a keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex more than the things so we can divide the circuit like that

We have decided it's on it leaving out the voice recognition with the size
all give you had it is finding offer voice recognition that was the main
so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it's it
so we can define in chile voice recognition is feasible we could go for over so
we just rejected and people voice recognition

and it's are market is going to be your own business range
our market and so this feed back to the marketing department is really about trendwatching
The methods we used to decide on Current trends and so one market trends that we did your traditional are usual market research study at with a hundred subjects the
able to our market research department and from our people in paris and milan interesting to see
I don't different parts of the world to for the marketing internationally
It's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research it's
market research it's not thing that people are looking for
as already highlight of a mile Marketing department they want something to do with fruits i wouldn't say the design
it was them may need to thing that people want to market research is that fancier

the thing with the sale a cells as you would need for them on the case and they
the case material i've been sent what we factory can actually give us The there's
the plastic which we were gonna go for anyway as the e main case housing and
wheel so in this case if you're looking at like that we can change the colour like from green battered into cd to do something like that so is that
be detachable mean maybe it you can change the body of the case casing the case outside it should be
that's from the feedback you can even the last meeting for me from your report it's not just a case of having little r or hidden somewhere that you want it to be obvious that it's our product and

it the amount of probably need here and she'd be doing all the time with the wood charger up i don't
battery it like it transfer long time
battery they use them quite frequently watch it and tell
But then if you think that watch it on your wrist so it on your whole point it's a new part of the whole time so
and it's small and it's portable and it is at different shape and the kinetic
we talked about kinetic charger we've decided to decided
No i the kinetic one to come become with a what she a battery the case and watch

a long this because we don't want customers will like charging like a mobile phone every day
It doesn't work quite easily to if you have to fold up a mobile phone
fold up a mobile phone myself just titanium it does mark very easily be true but i'm just wondering
that also a light it has to have different fascias for the phone
that's been really popular with mobile phones i don't see why not
So this is any ideas or mobile phone that got sidetracked on so that let's try to think about the features
If you think you got holding it You would be using your some sprite it's just like a mobile phone

At so the general findings from that was that in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls where People want a fancy look and feel rather than the current functional look-and-feel of remote controls they
we should point out that the first of those findings fancy look-and-feel is d most important is twice
it's still important but it's there it in order of preference to the subject we looked at
They're also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials i
also in this study of looked into the availability of some of the materials some
the materials some of the things so we looked at last time on that for jury are available
where you saying that people like this spongy feel the csi
is that really going to fit fancy look-and-feel it was them may need

and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into some higher
we are that you can do the four If i mention of feasibility whether we can incorporate that this at a low cost but
Some thing that it gives a bit sound or some sound and it just can incorporate
and it just can incorporate this would be more so you can take trendy also and technologically
So we can take another of financial feasibility of incorporating this
if it's and then press a button than having so we could incorporate
incorporating the company logo
mention that could be incorporating in the design

But then maybe that's the key is the one he's just sitting on the run of them
And you might for the touch pad very fast compared to all button like if you keep punching and then point or no
So oppose any not point got it There's a need for that a device you just has to click on that but it to simplify and on the top
and on the top of a look at it you buttons which are like volume or channel changing on could be on the pointing device that
so he knew not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent so for
of votes so if on this simpler board on the top we have this button for what tends to keep frequently changing the channels
the top and then be at touch that for that out there controls so have to
it like you get clocks know that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and
To pressure or you could top of recuperation
Or maybe like the limits adjusting the last thing some devices you put on key chains

be made to current remotes use this so the can pcb board which pretty printed circuit board which
the circuit and each which is connected to at different likes on the chip and say sends a different message and
today because you can print circuit board like that the
you could have just that their pcb circuit board and
With the lcd you don't have that with the printed circuit board
simple you'd you'd actually have to separate you have to separate circuit boards but that be joined by Why is all like some link between them it in the

So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually fired it's still important
It would just detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature is that
can we add in that are in attachment to closing feature
try to think about the features we can go to the bottom cost too much but one would
that was the main Which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognitions feature we are that you can
for that i like we had a of its response the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it so it could be like a
so keep that in that standardise because that's the most common feature all models if you look
this was just it was just a cost issue without but it's a good idea

We threw open to the field
and it's red be anti rsi e i'm
Just what you said reading the meaning of it completely using it
if we get have a contrast between if the whole thing it's gonna be this rubber saying it would be good to open a can see something quite fancy looking inside know how would
it in the ad to flip that you'd have some linking
read up occurs to me a applies to both
is it possible when we opened our laptop shell it's a little complex better when you press a button it then goes on to the phone display the art remote control display them
if we just use the shell as an example again you open that you put your lcd display there and you've got the buttons there's you hold in the palm of
On the palm we're gonna have to wrap a rope wants the anti
and lcd display on the top side of the flip top rubber i suppose and on the bottom side were fruit and vegetable

Specifically them on to try and you can get the tv for it so on them to undo them
can a guy it can you pick it up and then twenty for two minutes and then that's it for the night are
the most people have a light on in the room anyway so they could get when you got tv
if you're it you switch the tv on the on site then you pick ups change it then you put it on the side it's
is because if you think that what she although it's only a tiny and now it's it's always leaving for the whole day and they ran
and they ran out of the night when you leave them on the side and
a light cuisine then i would and she be the side a charging ones but
so have to the volume and the programme things like that on the lower side

And we're gonna think that the ports and alarm for getting lost things like that
and then we real it looking at the battery options
we also the the standard double and triple a which it with lower
which it with lower bit to bulky and then donna
like all were the life of the phonetic battery it like
so we could people put standard batteries and with this they could leave it in the sunlight for so charger are the
the normal batteries would be the cheapest a light cuisine
they've got joe things but the batteries a smaller think
it would to buy a how long list and there's a double as would last and all it replaced lost
if you vc has then the track so you could see you could put them virtually of right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one if you want
on that i did we decide and double or triple a batteries

presume that normal batteries of cheap this
No that's for the of the park ross what is used in some stress ball manufacturer and it's red
Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one i want to
Can we swapped i try and susan are the ones that we use all timer on the bottom part
an do say if they have got it if they've got these parts are already in stock then i went be cheap to re manufactured la will be
la will be cheap three menu item so it you
but we've Used cheap Relatively cheap and simple think the lcds not
there a price covers are going to be some relatively cheap to produce the if they

Welcome back everybody Hope you've had fun
This is where we talk about it's properties materials user interface and trend watching
we're going to have maybe a gue dui interface end of it in the middle of the flip top and
top and the topic the user interface which is what we
which is what we do doing computer have icons or touch pad or what do we just
icons you have is a good example of g you a topic user interface
most of the users would now we will acquainted with the certain simple pattern here so we're

most important is twice as important as the second technologically innovative which is in turn
which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use
Easy i have a key you could have a jew doubt think the thing
and you got some letters in nightclubs the art matters when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display you seen those
And the respond to the turn of your body is it possible
if you just putt the full charge turn lcd display or completely blank but i he's
about the matter that we just a very quick pass
make sense but if it turns out that it's each expensive would have to cut down somewhere else than it's worth thinking about it's i

also with our company and being forerunners end up being fashion into technology we also looked at a fashion update using a consultant on fashion design in paris and milan
as a fashion not be which relates to pay personal preferences another subject group we find
we find from our consultants in paris and milan who did attended all the design in fashion fears and the fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes shoes and furniture so should we be thinking of using
think it is it should be in the comedy does the picture he shows
My personal preferences would be like as already highlight

a wouldn't be thoughtful colour you would just be black and white that be touch
Maybe we could start with the black and white
we could make it black and white set the stripes but
you could have to up saying black one you could have sparked sleeping with three once for your little
got it sets closing we have forty minutes so or am i

and the availability of the components we have in stock that in mind
I'm pretty the solar is from the sound
the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else but pretty
they inside components pretty standardised across the board isn't
that pretty going in a clear detection

Let's start from the inside work
charger up i don't think you'd ever need to actually physically starts taking out to make it work
e i'm not how that would work because you surely all things would still be moving in the short distances but
like this hand so you get the degree it that you can we can pull that off
you could have some start listing you could pull out but

to our this is that the chip called the tio one eight three five which
from everything else and i'm trying to imagine clean liking highest is
do the last meeting we spoke about a beeper thing that we should talk about
A car engine meeting now i
It's either that or We only have forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed in the middle

a space one dynamo might take more space
space you actually need a physical to solve handle to wind up
and the for the same reason your any using it for incredibly shown on that are just send the signal and then you finished of it and you put it
a on a calculator they're quite the quite they can they all play with the identical
but if you bore it's if it's you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less you would lose it so much
does the picture he shows what are the standard models all for the computers you so you
