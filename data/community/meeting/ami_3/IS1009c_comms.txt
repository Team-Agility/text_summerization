they should be extra features like lead buttons maybe i'd be if too many buttons are pressed
when you press a button when you do with that you complete a specific connection that means when you
that means when you press a button that will be it's more it's a cute and that me the button and it will send some signals through the wires and then at the chip
and then at the chip will sense that connection and most that data but it is pressed suppose you have pressed
suppose you have pressed channel one button number one you have placed than the old the chip but that the number one button was pressed it
light make you have got a signal by pressing the button that's the
and also you can see there and it's like all of the axis four buttons make it then you press
make it then you press a button that's a cute and the button will be activated it will

Therefore message is will be controlled in the same manner they should be extra
to the way that was the remote control it's important but do you do is raise are loose
of which is like it is very much important for the electricity fiddle to the remote controller and also a capacitator
and how it works how the remote controller works when you press
it's it this is a normal remote control that and the next
usually the case is and card flats that of a vc usually or not my remote control it

interface designer has mentioned that's be there what we should have an on off button and also
as an interface design i would give more emphasis on the interface how the remote looks like so that it decided that
that so you can design and interface which is really simple and it is user-friendly you when a
no this is an interface for that right for a remote which child can use this is user-friendly
like switches like we use buttons for user interface
And are to uid is supposed to come up with a user interface design

Then you should have a button and that should get this can be used for increasing or decreasing the wall you
Every button and the individual button has it's a one more school suppose
these are the sake you would sell and they need the buttons can you see the
We discover push buttons for in the
you want buttons are used functions are obvious and they want as few buttons as possible and they don't care

this time i'm going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote control of design on
I have just a belief don few of components which we've required for the remote control construction the first
and also are using of cutting component components like if we want
like if we want to have different colours blue red green so we have to use a some a call on the component components And
And they all are the component we should all be have in the remote control or is that a sister of
these are all this that technical in a two electronic components of components which at which we have to use in the remote control or a
and not and if you open the remote control or you have this set you said keyboard and few electronic components like

and it has an interface controls we interface controls the chip
And this such i did interface as a minimum buttons and all the
So the lambs that's interface which can be created
User interface concept the interface type supplements

maybe it should have the electric electricity saving feature
not the most important feature i would like to have it might be more would be the speech recognition feature
that this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have
As many simple interface which has all but important features
and we should develop one or two features we can really do on an ad campaign if we try to
Someone is like different types of features buttons you can have a new but there were taught at the lower end of that and

Then they should they they should be some buttons which can control features like the carlo colour of the picture of the contrast sharpness brightness of the picture
That these at some of their remotes which are different and shape and colour but they have many buttons so
we wanna have something or or maybe bright colour fall

was pressed it was it produces a morse code line signal specific to that button
more school suppose that use it has pressed a button one then it would have a spare the circuit will generate a specific morse code to put that back button and the transistor
that's the that a morse code has been generated like they did it's like you Now
you Now that signal that morse code has to be amplified but the transistor that
but the transistor that is the use of transistor be which we use in the remote control it will amplify
that we need cs that amplify that more morse code signal that it up it will will know which what actually it has to do then it

So a remote can be it can be our design which can have the y so they could deny is as you can record your own voice
so this is one of the interface a lot of the remote which has this by voice of recognise that and it says multipurpose
And the plus the prefer it's would be sp or to incorporate speech recognises bits for a response to use this voice for the particular function
so i would like to include this feature which is call this voice recogniser
person's what it's like maybe different people will be having different voices so i
voices so i would like to have a close a new data

I'll or technical manager have as then said that she feels it should have a chip
it for school pros we have to go for that sophisticated and all that you feel complete chip
nobody uses it because you need a car sophisticated chip and also
chip and also it's better be go for the ordinary buttons
they're more back into saw feel spongy feeling things with maybe a little cloth on so

So the components of the things should be button bob hope's inferred the infrared bulb is battery chips liars and maybe
components like it you can see a chip there which is having a team games and also our capacity
and also our capacity of capacity or three or sisters and also would resonate it up
are all of that upon the components have all those things that could chip but they would transistors

My heart a child lock a
the we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the heart of the remote control it if it is
control it if it is not the fish and then everything but it's going to be like a then if it's less efficient so it you should be should have a highly sophisticated one and it should

and the transistor that amplify the signal and the led which translates the signal into infrared light make
control it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the ed and which translates the signal into an inset infrared that's inside and the tv
that's inside and the tv can see the infrared light and seeing the signal seen the signal three it reacts appropriately that we need cs
it will get some signals from it and it will it with chi it's just a send the signal signals to the be integrated circuit next

And we have a circuit board in a remote control to go to the
keyboard the green one is a circuit board actually
actually building the circuit board is pretty easy and also it's it's an inexpensive it's it costs
because it you can build these circuit boards on a buck and it's just printing nothing like you don't need to use why it's not exactly

compact for personal favourite was it would be t shaped and
and all the important buttons are that in this small compact
And lake colby have a design but before we have seen some a few things like that instead of buttons we have some schools up
and i've been looking around at what designed every year different things are popular and in
and in my research this you have an update fruit and vegetables it's a really popular and you were tired
Right colour for all trendy design and strong
Then you design compact and strong

Which can be they could be to buy a otherwise recognise the in the television
to the tv but have some recogniser which are recognise they use those whites and accordingly to change its functionalities that this
it's not distance problem it's recognise single person's what it's like
so i say it is good morning and that you switch on it to recognise
it to recognise my wise and the switch on

up but i have a push button requires a simple chip and the me that we have the scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range it for school pros
on the scroll-wheel pushbutton can you can achieve scrolling by repeated be pushing a button
was a different like you can go first switches like buttons or scrolls it which we used to do before ten years before like nobody
this is the individual actions to be taken up the led to have to look and

So that people are buying it now because in particular we smaller items that's a very important fact
people like something that really fits in your hand simple was beautiful
if we try to sell people are there's too many great feature is the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere so you've got a

and maybe display clocks so that people could to Could see the time what shall they want to watch also mentioned was
And even possibly a time or two so that people can prove i look at their favourite to a program on the right from the remote
Are are we all in agreement that's that what we discussed last time
you can also we can if it is a rechargeable one then people can use it for a long time so
eyes i'd spend a lot of time on the internet sitting around doing the same thing and
others that we have a light up on time to sell it for should be for other people get out there christmas item and we

in general The idea is that it should be something that it's not difficult to use
so sometimes the use of finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that so you can
and my findings from this is the small is beautiful
but other than of a remote stop for the whole find it will work because
in this phase the two of you no and fancy in have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay it says here You

it's it costs less than what you print of the people because i
because i when you are building a some steak use some of those are cute and also wires it's better to go for printing because it you
that do those prints would act as a biased and so that's a keeps
and also for the electronics we can use a simple and regular of it that an advanced chip on the print
print also in so it includes the infrared sender
they don't want to have to square it small print you want buttons

in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented or her method of working meeting there
suppose if it is thirty degrees outside forty degrees outside it should it be able to address is the temperature the price and listen to it i know
we have five minutes to the end of the meeting
thing and then one out people's houses or meetings or anything like that i try to notice what remote controls people have and if it
And what we have to see side in this meeting is the concept of the remote
in other our next meeting will be in thirty minutes and
here and we come back in the write us thirty minutes according to our timetable here

also mentioned was it should be it should have a very short learning curve
and also has mention an interesting features that each would have maybe a channel
Particularly this may be small children that equip and they're watching channel that is some desirable it would be
this message us could be switch on off mess age or switch to next channel and i say it was that thing that john lewis a smidgen want to a particular channel like
by the choosing which you can spot the channels if we don't want to see this touch and then we can stop it to the fault standard always see worse so
and next back and channel that which you can keep on the scrolling the channels one by one next

The speech recognition is most important as for
will work because the speech recogniser click it has it's one of those issues it's not
or like speech recognition would also be a supplement for her
be a supplement for her speech recognition feature would be a supplement
so why we put down speech recognition if possible paintings more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is

and it should be racist into high as as a low temperatures suppose if
right mind that the that is i'm interested in what the competition is doing and wanna see how we can make our sauce different from the competition so
the competition so i've really be looking at the press and the ads that are out there for a remote control or s eyes i'd
eye-catching is important it's gotta
is important it's gotta look you it's gotta look appealing i don't think
and are preferences as far as i'm concerned are we gotta get to the market before the competition it

now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television this
Then they should be but then beach can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a daily we should example
example if you're watching the french programme and you would like to have a subtitles in english that they should be a channel which can read that this may can use them in the television so that the user can see the the subtitles on the screen
you can bring their one him down and you can watch you can do it by talking you can watch the tv not the most
It's an integrated programme programmable sample sensor speaker you want it
good morning like around eight o'clock on want to see the news in the television so i say it

and as energy source to be all for the basic battery orange and use a hard dynamo i kinda provision of energy more than
more than what is that you shake actually to provide energy so with that also we can have an back to be or
the components of the concept is the energy what energy

the first one is key is to keep all the components like integrated suck you would battery it's a fact that writes like
if we will be able to me least a rechargeable battery can be should be need not go for our high-performance battery even if it is a mobile
even if it is a mobile phones battery it quite can't you can't charge much it's not
it for a long time so in that way we can cut the cost but it yet that we have to me the battery as rechargeable one

From everyone to have to see you how old she best could market to do this product at the within the budget and that was given
is not this as bank always remote which cannot be misplaced but it's impossible to misplace i But
too big to misplace it's funny i
the product can be the delivered into different cases usually
so you've got a narrower selection down to one and two things that we're gonna say are really great about our new product and
And the marketing expert with a product evaluation in this phase

No say these are presentations but as far as a decision making week getting to that after but if
No a presentation was good and she really explored all the options
left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert
and the marketing expert has to present for her of thing

to different systems that exist are infra-red or radio waves
then suddenly if if you were he gets a telephone call and if you want he doesn't want to switch on the at tv but you can read use the sound you can
if you want to see we if we want to see them anchorage and then if you say just say in mind china that the the remote will automatically the switch to the mind johno to the tv but have
and it says multipurpose use it can be used for tv can be used for cable satellite it can be used for vcr dvds and audio
i am that's gonna be our impulse perch it's sad that i cannot it's gonna be a little
and for the movie just do the lab sample sensors be sample speaker
from you have a tv system i'm the user and my family members that they use that i

In addition to that to make it to sell the marketing manager who wishes that it's be very attractive for like she
that it decided that it is attractive the customers

quite hard plastic so that it can be struck even
Like we can have all made materials such as plastic rubber wood titanium but be kind
and you were tired of hard plastic and hard metal they're more

can you you can see the tva double one eight three five really believe that it cheap
a it's like you're recording on a question already and then you're expecting an answer from
they use that i will already the cord up one question like good morning like around
You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches
Are if you have any questions you can always contact me or or you coach i suppose
