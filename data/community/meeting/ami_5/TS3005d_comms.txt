Remote control is colours the different step me different target groups
then we have to skip every remote because how many colours
so each remote with a special colour
you don't need for all those for the special colour the one you one remote

Also The buttons are easy to find it was a
Are all the buttons easy to find not only these buttons all buttons
this is easy enough think the options buttons are not but the easiest way to
away i'd if you have the button at the right i don't think you can find the option button that easy
Maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use
Easy volume up button

this the scroll button on the microphone on on the side here on the anti r and r logo
using scroll buttons sides uh but
You push the scroll button and it's that's out
so you can scroll than two scroll up button
integrated scroll wheel and push button because when you push a
it again push it you have to tap the options we know button here and then scroll down with today with the but

It's easier than the regular a remote control
they are a lot easier to find and and then on the regular remote controls where you have
because i have the regular controls lie as
controls lie as you can see the screen out and
it's easy to use their regular remote control because

that special because the microphone and the lcd screen also For a new
there's an lcd screen and then microphone
Lcd screen scroll
you have all buttons on it which is like a microphone extra lcd screen extra scroll it's fair
But then we have to scrap lcd display
First of all it didn't think in that we were able to make an lcd screen first point but

remote control may be sold to younger people
Remotes and younger people usually
and younger people usually use remote controls put on the volume They're not turn up the volume
but a wooden remote control only helps for all people we discuss

This is about the total remote control could maybe three
That's really important things off or fact Are a form of this year is are is remote control
is remote control fits in us
so it's also a very handy if you make a site curve way to make the remote control very thin at the bottom at a bus am i supposed to make it
At least the most useful remote control of are to be manufactured because
you can see the remote control to the armour
like i went with the remote call and then if we knew we
call and then if we knew we have to we had to remove them in with our remote control

i have to agree all colour colours or doubles never did that much now solid
course but it also make what colour not as one single colour what would Like thing
we do have to fill in this colour know counts
And special colours fruity colours
but it's a special colour and just rubber colour you have to add
But the colours it because like she told Is that all colours way at four
colours special colours all the colours you want because
but you when you use more to one colour it's a special colour
they use the colour that's not already need a rubber they use special colour shirts at it

bit harder but if you touch the options and
but you have three then you have here is written option then you get teletext button right
which can change options of the remote to something
remote control because when you push on the options menu you get the the various options intel explains entirely explain

there's also i see that we make the small menu the options menu become available one pressing the scroll but in any
still be used everything there it's very handy to put it not under the options menu in but
Yes exactly that's the teletext option menu isn't taking the much it's taking much part of the screen so it's very
if you put it on the top you always get see the options menu

We could lose the scroll wheel we could make a just
we could make a just a regular scroll wheel
did you change the scroll wheel and
If we lose a scroll wheel and make it certainly depending then dependent on the touch screen
We drop the scroll wheel
Ed the scroll wheel is dropped
so we lose the scroll wheel is

controls where you have to find out what which sign or means on a free button so you have to

and the screen light blue
this is that tells all interface of the lcd screen
But that's fun to just lcd screen you can have text
too flexible because it has lcd screen
lcd il ski to touch screen as feature
We put that on the screen fruit and lines being drawn the two or three centimetres so a bit
so i actually could make an lcd screen but michael we could make mike that was d screen then you could

mark from could be just a minor the whole on the button
to use it for would put an hour and an extra button and we can
erase it but it's the button where you can switch channels that means when
that means when you are wanting you go to you can off you go to five you can go back to one with a button
functions because for every button you have to pay and
button you have to pay and there are different screenshot so a different screen so
Pushbutton no we don't have push button
But now button supplements we don't have a button supplements

the bay when you scroll away and back it will be normal
easier because of the with the you have to push the arrows and with a normal tv remote
also know that just a normal colour fruit colours normal
fruit colours normal of yellow
but we are we have yellow rats the black titanium
which we got you could make it always black not a normal remote

it looks fancy especially with the green colour and the curves which we decide it's
Only what happened to the single curve Let's talk about something
No the single curve idea was
Single on a single curved double
curved double curves of it and see it a three dimensional but isn't three-dimensional
curve you made notes curved like that's
that's manhood square was curved the curvous
to make it a flat one sings know curve to get know curves
and the single curve to uncurved
five any make in then you can make Space single curve
So it would be curved single curve

And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition
that they've called you say required to do the to the speech recognition they should
but it's for remote control it would satisfy that means the speech possibility
the speech possibility to colour
you should drop the speech recognition
so it so we drop the speech recognition together with the speaker

As easy to use as for a number of elderly people
For young people it's easy to use
Young means sixteen to forty years an ld for
numbers or better because we design it for young people especially

As people regularly read from last top to write that sir
So all fancy enough means does it's Comes to younger people and elderly people
it was a big requirement of the old people
To satisfy younger people

Hold it was hard to lose
Hard to lose it is and is easy to find
is good so it should just a question to be hard to lose it's difficult to lose
that would be quite hard to learn to use not convinced

it's not going to work or people we have rubber
They don't work so hard to find department
So you would say communicate doing our individual work
now or maybe session of five minutes to get and then work
work but operated of the range or it doesn't

And dropdown menu or pull out menu comes out and
And a menu was to say that this table is easy to use
probably to simulate the whole working process have a menu
have a menu second have a meeting for several weeks

comes out and you get and get options become available it's easy settings remote settings etcetera so
because we designed it to be very fancy set
if for some thing you they didn't adjust the set the microphone and then you lose it then you have lost it
and then you have the audio settings channel settings video settings
Use a file save us see a pj peg

on the top because not stop it has the screen which
With two berries the whole but and then top and if you're holding it quite a lot of think
but we're gonna make it yellow or red and then you add
or red and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have no

everybody's a critic recall and
a critic recall and they wanted a lot of features on this thing
In it as a more fancy functions not really many features
feature and that you can change channels feature and that you can
feature and that you can change the volume this feature which can
but you have the screen features are the features the
finance and i have a excel sheet to do that
that's you've got features that don't exist in excel sheet

And some more time but we might have improve the quality of work which
some more time doing the individual work fixed

But which you can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we can my requirements from the of the users If i made
like question is more big enough we can say it's true or false by steps
first question is the design fancy
that's think it works get the tool by middle or by no chance something and now we are

We also made some ideas about how the options many would work using
the room for and that was the idea to be creative so
Doesn't stand out ideas in your head And this

Questionnaire was seven point scale from one to seven from two false like question
We have two points spare a one point
and maybe i should work out of the room when you discuss at this point the leadership
And we other points to improve this whole process

we should square the sample speaker is for
The sample speaker is to put four points
but the only option is to drop the sample speaker
Too much sample speaker and sample sensor

Difference between lines and text and the pen
that's it is easy to get one of those the digital pens are so into
a smartboard on what about the digital pen
a normal pen and then the only you use it's to get it on a computer

a spongy because of hard rubber
you have to add something to the rubber to make great you don't say here's remember
You don't sell green rubber plants Right
but the rubber soles or is it all black

this the one number two numbers that so we know that the patients
then because otherwise we count calculate anything from the results
and maybe the r can use that thing to count the numbers functions
know counts a number of functions because for every

which is for the detailed design meeting
the detailed design meeting
that's fine and aspect where we can afford what we have designed if we can
And that pops a pop-up screen in five minutes to the meeting
I have i officially close the meeting and

Electronics simple chip advanced
chip advanced chip right
But it but it's a regular chip on print
d display it scrap or Advanced
we have advanced chip on print

but just make the back of this part a bit bigger so that it in a student
the next part might be a little bit Difficult to do In a group but

if we can comments the final part which use the production or project evaluation how did we
a look on that and we're going to calculate the production cost or if they are
and we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time
and then we're going to the project or product evaluation we just did our

not main documents this time
And missed when i was time we are stands for
my task was this time to put up a questionnaire
have so some things i had to my presentation day already told so
To project because of the deadline she didn't have time to have you didn't have time to the to make a very that's the quality of presentation
I played same time solitaire

space and the batteries can be located over there so
as you if texas as usual we will do one of those things in your hand
and no one battery but too small battery
but it's more about the energy source and do use a hand
and do use a hand dynamo battery kinetic or solar cells
Solar cell now it to a battery

Created separate folders because was
because was they did a little bit see in our Shared project documents folder i if
safe in the folder so it as project
as a why should we be separated from each other in a difference different rooms
i'll go and the information was a bit low some tie in a in a

sit for that since it's almost my final slide
five minutes so i'll move on to i my last slide yes
because i have to write the final report now but
of this so try to include in the final report

everybody's very happy of these i have a with a result so celebration

or if they are under or act twelve euro fifty
but then i'd i don't think you can estimate to twelve and a half
Twelve euro fifty and
you can draw for it would whites the end

the what we can make a brown dark brown that would
It sometimes i received like five the emails that a moment and then

i if that's the best way to when it is when it is too expensive to quickly we arrange it and say this is that's what we
