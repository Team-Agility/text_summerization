start with you on how do you think the remote should function for the user
would it be for user to have display on this remote control on which you can see functions

mode and remote control shoots up control a device that is a subset of equipment for insist
so one re one remote control for all your equipment
Yes so one thing one remote control should control one or more at ease of equipment and the way of

It's a remote control the television
the television remote control
in this case control that the television

then the discussion maybe the time for sebastian
and now it's time is to have a little discussion about what's the product should be and how we should look but

The second is the technical functional design
so if someone of you comes up with ids i'll try to translate them and technical functions but the might be some
that's just the basic technical function so that was
that's just the fun the technical function is what should the remote control do what is

project the remote control
it's a universal remote control for customers to buy it just knowing store It's
i i've seen these remote controls with this little stick which you can move forward sight words know these things

We're going to do a little tool training for the tools we are going to use a during the meetings we are going to have here
before we think about remote control we will work with some of the tools we have here

we we will focus is internationally so the product
It's not for for philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product right

Yes i have some technical issues which i would like to present do you before we start discussion because
but take these things into account when you start the discussion

we will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how was it should function and all those things the market
so the product a will be sold if there is market interest in more than one country and
do you have anything already we add idea about how the market will respond to that such product or what we should take

which consists of three different design stages
the functional design the conceptual design and the detailed design
the first stage the functional design we are going to search for the user requirements and we will
the other design stage is we will discuss that later so welcome

and i'm we can find more goals for the product we're going to develop
We're not developing this product for a specific centre are we
just developing this product then we want so that to a very brought up public so
or what we should take it in account when developing such product
because we what we want to develop a trendy product so

how exactly does it work in the technical sense
that and rubber ability just like some sense that
sense that remote it should work on different tvs or even different

the telephone technical function white what you said is just there pressing the button you should change state of the tv that's just
it just should change the tvs state so

a point to the tv it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to tv so
for tv always in a word of a tv so i don't

so You can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to any questions
maybe the time for sebastian to show his presentation

all of these stages mean that we do some individual work prepare and then and need to discuss are The for the ring in the

and sebastian is here in the role of industrial designer is that correct
first about my role of the industrial designer i
role i'll just i give you a everybody some test call input and

for insist dvd player cell phones video and audio equipment so one
used if you should equipped infrared and bluetooth together in one remote

the profits we are looking for this product is fifty million euros
and the production cost should not be more than at twelve euro fifty so
twelve euro fifty

is here as we user interface designer and sebastian
and first of all it should be original it should be trendy and user-friendly those are
and it's very easy for user to switch we as
our user interface i had it's more industrial think a point
so it should be as user interface for feeling should be good to understand you

this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes so
gentlemen just to remind we'd we have five minutes left for this meeting
next meeting starts in thirty minutes and

things sebastian told us a few things about be technical implement implications

been said like control multiple device
but there are lots of the device already using infra-red so
the device should either be rechargeable very easily or

but them bluetooth might be problem but bluetooth
cellphones have to integrate bluetooth also and it's it seems to work quite so
But you can use bluetooth all the time twenty four hours a day but

so when you're not able to point at the device and the range is very handy or

we're not living in the in nineteen eighties anymore so infra-red is not
but the infra-red it's but old-fashioned if you would call that but all tvs
but all tvs are equipped with infra-red so

It's important that the laptops are other exactly on the square Forty cameras
the remote control we are going to develop will have a selling price of about twenty five euros the profits

the weighting is for our marketing expert Rude
role but it is here as the marketing expert is

things and the technical possibilities in possibilities so if
And and that also will remind people of some new texaco possibilities which are available and which

then we have decided to make a white board system
You control on the board using this pen but there
all are and what smart board notes should be kept in the same file so do not

i will do is the agenda for today for this meeting
and this is the first meeting to generate some some ideas about it

is that the restriction for a range the operating range to so
a tv so i don't think The range should be a problem to that but if you
to that but if you want to get it working with radio and you're in outside the garden with just one speaker Then maybe the range should be

To present eight to show us a file you need to that place it in your project documents folder which
i'm red and the documents it should be in the project documents folder if you want

so the main port and the main points you are timing is our focus on the inter a probability and
point it so in that case infrared should there may be be restriction to that

We are going to use a private project method cheering at this development which consists

the financial part of this project implicates there's not going to be a high end product that cost price is
that cost price is very low

You can insert in new slide or whiteboards file by a i they're using the instance function or by taking the next button or the blank button it's quite the same
you must feel the buttons for volume or whatever and
you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it the
The basis of the painting on the buttons should not face from
Always have the soft buttons always Clear that paint on it Lamar
Maybe we could only like the buttons that are applicable at that moment or i

current colour you can choose not a colour and
and you can they can choose the line width
so now i have a different Line width and the colour quite
as a little training i will ask you to do it first to draw a your own animal on the new slide with at a different colour a different line width then the one and that's like that
but it different animal with the different colour and a different line width
I'm just i'm guessing what should be my favourite animal

channels or change between tracks on the cd or chapters
because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries ever use every other week

i'm you've got an email from a row account manager about it
and euro your individual actions or
actions or your personal coach will probably email you about that

it really like a regular a regular whiteboard

are so it should be visible all in dark too so wednesday

sensors so they're not grab it here with the led more

Good morning miss the pm you today
you today I was a base a trip
I was a base a trip to boston
