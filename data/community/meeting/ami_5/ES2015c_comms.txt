also got be integrated push button which is what we made for you it's very
be come in like incorporate that with the scroll button as to the to
simple would go with the push button
right you could link with the scroll button and
so it depends on what we wanted to scroll buttons or just the push buttons

but at the choice of buttons as we've developed some
they quite flexible design more than you don't have to use individual buttons you can just
for links into the different depends on what type of buttons we have an input
this them in we make depending on what kinds of the design minutes to just black buttons
so that would have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons
as i'm has its own buttons are you don't necessarily need to have it on remote

the back so i had so many buttons on and the shape was so some that's that are be pressing like a volume but instead of that one button because
flat and you just have to pressed on these tiny little buttons but

and do we have to make some key decisions on our remote control concept and how we're gonna make a what it really is and that thing the meeting
been doing some research into the different components that we could use what's available to us to actually make the remote control test
test will have to look at how the remote control is actually made and what
slightly i know i've had a remote control before which you can tell which is the front and the back so i had
Now it's just a ways back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control and
so we can live up to our purpose of having a very fashionable remote control
The second most important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be technologically innovative so we do
and the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use
it is a good sales plan to say and the remote control them all these patterns this one
we five real something that you granny would want a remote control

Do you think that we should keep All the buttons so one same colour just to keep it to the simplest o'clock
one colour it's face could have its own colour of button
What we're gonna do but the cost of buttons functions course and forms and that and say yes like what
it the buttons what functions will show we have
that's brightness colour tone all that

And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and input data
because command interface requires you to type text role commands and input at the keyboard so the numbers
we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for remote control as it would be
we had decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line up and so if they were
That was called command interface
Command line interface

there are two types of user interfaces to stick graphical
to stick graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point device
So you must for the graphical user you must need some presentation for the graphics like an lcd
So that's just off the graphical for the pointing aspect
but that we could incorporate some of the graphical user points as

welcome to the third meeting conceptual design that's a
is it possible to plug designs on to this type of rubber
the remote control would be cheaper design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface to make
and i looked at the design reports from previous years here real remote and just so can
and so i suppose i'll come out in out to the design development they're happy to

you were saying about solar power not maybe not working and doors but a lot of calculators
and just so can we can work off of them see how fashion to change
do you work with rubber has already given the market but
So if it's not working this have to shake it a bit and revitalise is it
audio because we how other televisions work but we know everyone
You'll be working how we will be working on the look and feel design
Pop in tarot will have to work together using modelling clay

titanium is not to be possible in know it just to be on top budget really that
it i don't see how all of like a rubber plate going on top or would stay there you go sort
there you go like a clip on plastic plate It
Like plastic with rubber can get on top
So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casing is rubber and the
again we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons
i plastic and put it in rubber or plastic

with our research team of phones and in new multiple all options scroll buttons that was
And the phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons that actually that control controls that are behind the rubber so you
so you can change the buttons when you change in the face it's generated mean
up if it's flat then i got like on a cell phone a mobile phone so called a flat and
of it if it's just like constructed in the same way as but the front cover mobile phone you can you take off the hard cover and then there's the makes it the buttons and then you get the

i'm just gonna receive it interface concept with his A
A first of all explain what the user interface us
interface to make it more trendy and we still have the money
And maybe learn from mistakes of all are interface that can be too complicated for people to use
User interface concept
and the user interface design so those are the trendy comes in and you'll

i when people will be movie remote around a lot but
do it all remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television
maybe for the television that people have in the kitchen
Right a remote for more simplistic style right
televisions agree i if we can make a remote that will be universal all the different kinds of
some tvs will have the option of like living room style movie style and that they said

the ousted a kinetic energy
the kinetic energy is transformed into a power to make a circuit what
as and Also energy saving see all producing the energy you don't need an x then also the battery supply all solar panels you just
you can have the solar energy then you can store the energy in you say it just needs to
this was it would be really annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic
but it is the kinetic thing was stressed about lies it's instant energy don't have to
i'm the kinetic energy would probably deep into the budget
that as the energy we've decided on and kinetic right so
that fully kinetic energy

and everything is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates it's
just with the lighting in the buttons and Face plates
is we've worked hard for the personal face plates in this meeting and
plates in this meeting and like sticks that fruits
a wimp should see what the success of the first face plates are busily to keep in mind

as it would be less complicated and the controls would be more user friendly
We we also have to keep in mind more design an hour more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons that
and then tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness

but they on thought it was that aren't with the lcd that means we need really advanced chip and
and the advanced would have to go with a lcd c display My

What is the hand power dynamo
where you manually charge it up the power like you
power which we've been sitting inside a building which is where it's gonna be used might not be quite so useful That
I was i suppose a on and on some buttons you would have the power would be some symbol and if you wanted
Like we'll have the numbers of the channels and we'll have a channel changer and volume and power
so we just going for a power channels volume
them all these patterns this one is channel volume and you cannot any power

there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source we could use
i don't think you would really be with cutting edge technology wise kinetic
wise kinetic energy is a new idea that's been used by some watches and that devices where you just shake in the device and it gives it to power the
we could go for the kinetic energy source that are
I i like the kinetic energy source idea

lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat that's got
rubber which might be mall ideal for the anti rsi e it's
sie it's like at the same rubber that's used and stress balls and things that says rei not so stressful on how does that would
i'm what i said with the rubber casing is that would be were rubber encapsulate in all of these Chips and diodes and delicate technology as
that would it at that would be an end so more internal casing and the rubber would
and the rubber would just be that what's in contact with the human eye
Maybe be if to be if it was just remorse rubber coating which is on the case so
there's there's certain phone that has like a rubber case in that like
you can get outside casing far ipods and something that's just as protective as it's it stops it
i will rubber is some more translucent product to use so
ask the case which we pulled aside and rubber

on the agenda for this so this particular meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design and
of thing the meeting will be forty minutes one and
one of your rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals so maybe
we have five minutes to finish our meeting
and in closing so we have five minutes will be meeting
will be meeting again in thirty minutes
and will reconvene in thirty minutes it back

source that are that's quite an advanced technology is not been
because a lot about a house cat our dog
the advanced chip in arlington with what buttons we would can house so

we could possibly you take a more abstract design like look at the basic
like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables and then just
and then just really like a strip it down to like really basic shape so we don't have to
so we don't have to make something in the shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real swimming or a store we see
that's we can just go for it make it a selling point that is just the basic i

they'll include good like ten to earlier there are these different options
and a point device a mice for for a control that
so this is pointing device that doesn't include
and as concert a one point five elements on a scale of ten that's brightness
but it would seem silly if we do point to have anything else just have to not important though

is actually made and what happens inside the casing because wall you'll feel does
against f lee back inside the guy that i
What's the raised up buttons So you can feel
the first one is that they should be a fancy look-and-feel and so the current functional look and feel
all something to happen in contrast to last in the feel the material is expected to be spongy again we've already

the recent fashion update to have a quite a fashion watchers in paris and milan is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
that fruits and vegetable things if that's going to work for us sound
It's the fruits and vegetables is the only Area that i find rather jarring everything else
given the market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
like like photos of fruits from our product
have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect Are we
they're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg
It was due to the fruit and veg eating right

are all separate apart from the chip which will probably decide whether we buy a simple regular advanced we can do is that later
i'm probably there is regular chip was supposed to simple we could possibly
the next decision is chip on print i don't exactly that
it is whether we weapon for the simple the weight that was the advanced chip in
so it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we going to meet so it's a medium
That's called medium or regular

thing you can have it as a little picture we have a screen is lines across it which is was
Screen settings was use zero point five times an hour place
and that they said that's easier point eight times an hour which is actually

source is not necessarily a battery is about to see there
we could use the basic battery but that brings
but that brings it thing we need to be recharged and the bulk the size of it as and then
so there is a one battery be as most remotes use two batteries i believe so

all the other thing is the individual components so we'd have to get it in separately i like
i surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television so
my so that comes like on the other individual television set itself as i'm has

and that at ed that's the light emitting diode so we
so you're pushing the light is coming from the bat appreciate
from the bat appreciate it as coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words But
the top or a light up ideas on the gonna stick to that's and then
we need a more advanced one or four the lighting the interior lighting system
i if we should go into like adjusting light levels things like that because different televisions

does main internal feature it is a circuit board which contains all the that at it on x and also the contacts with that power source is not
there are several components of the circuit board that we need to consider when i will be getting them from what they'll be made of
made of including the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip which is where
but diodes transistors resonators resistors and passes it could pass it is all need to be considered as
i like out the most like effective circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at ed of
circuit i don't think it would matter the buttons would be through there The top casey i'm you could

Display and the glow in the dark thing Might be difficult
that if we having a simplified display anyway you that will probably won't have to focus so much not be more than the numbers
I certainly think of symbols for like the volume displayed and like that
or a store we see the relief of displayed
of displayed in a really make it a quite abstract if that's facing more with what we doing instead of

that's a powerpoint presentation up and running
And there's been sitting your powerpoint presentations to the
i'm i've lost my Powerpoint i can't remember what it's got at the components
half in the numbers came of like not a bunch of grips that like powerpoint in a trying call

that sounds pretty easily
But the casing we're probably the best if we're going to be anti rsi d and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty
Pretty straight forward
pretty just the basic But the functions

us It's aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage hey rick or Shall we are they are By the human user

the keyboard so the numbers are like a keyboard you pressing
a keyboard you pressing the numbers for for you want
grapes think that's number two years and then the students

in you say it just needs to be in like for a certain amount of time paid a like a few hours
that's the time lcd type things
the so my method was mainly web-based research this time around i also spoke
time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris and

it be strange to we speak rating are they
you can watching tv in the dark then
But we stick to tv based maybe tv shows or
like what our ideas to combat these problems in a way

i'm you could work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job be fine
But they still need to fit in to people's the core though

The other one was audio settings mono stereo
settings mono stereo pitch
it's a problem with international a appeal if we have audio because

slide f and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop up
saying is that was the most popular thing we came up out of your market research and we should keep to that rather than moving to our animals because
I so ideally think of age markets as so something

that might be getting to specific a wimp should see what the success
Right given that information We need to start making some more specific decisions
And your personal coach will be the best of the information for it's a half

There's the high and how it dynamo which is the thing that was used to which is fifty years ago the ousted
I have a shorter report free to do it it took
and to be confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost report so
as so something that'll appeal to the fifties we five real something

and then not so great to dispose of environment bi There's
it would use the impact if it's got to something as they wouldn't damage just it's not so easy of maybe
Be bold and innovative and hope this
