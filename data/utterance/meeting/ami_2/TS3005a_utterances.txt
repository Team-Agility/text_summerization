is my and problem and i hope you will introduce of in a few minutes as
i'm the project manager of this project and
and what gets hopefully we'll get acquainted to each other a little tool training
a little tool training with these two fangs take a look at
we have to discuss because we have to create a product and then
as you probably have noticed there are a little black fields on the table we have to put your
that field so that no cameras can see your face there are cameras
i said i'm the project manager and i'm hoping
and i'd like to hear where you are on what your functions are on this project let's
and my function is user interface design so
My name's the anymore i'm the marketing expert My job for
My job for the company to promote company of more products to the customers So
we have some expertise from Different pieces of the company that's good
as said we're working on projects and the aim
on projects and the aim for the project is to create a to design a new remote control which the
which the has to be original trendy and user friendly and
and i hope we have expertise to create such a project just a product
and the way we hope to achieve that is through the following that it's consist of three
it's consist of three phases name be the functional design conceptual design and detailed design as
design as you can see all these faces consists of two parts namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss
have here only told about the cameras microphones but
smart boards as you can see you can give a presentation on them and
soon as you also noticed this presentation document is in our project folder and every
project folder and every document you put in this folder is possible to show that here in a meeting room
smartboards but will mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder As you can see this is same
As you can see this is same tool bar as located here
the most functions we will use will be to add a new page
and this is the pen with it you can draw all the board
and then you can write things like test or whatever you want as you can see you have to move
it's not such a farce board it's a smartboard but
it's a smartboard but also a slow board but
you can write things and you can also When you click here that erase things so we have
to do that just simply create a new one and start
but you shouldn't believe and buy a page just create
and it also let's see it's here change the colour of your pen they
and change the line width a fire
because i'm going to ask you to draw your favourite animal
sheet with different colours showed
colours showed you how to pick a card and also with different
save this characteristic can be just a one word i'm
david koresh characteristics is at the lower make it carries
and i hope also reach a lot of what this project so
That's an idea favourite animal
i draw a line and strong
and strong A dolphin because this intelligence one and
you very much see we have some drawing sounds in this group that
animals as words Sounds good
back to business back to the money part
from the finance department i've learned that we're aiming for a selling price of twenty-five euros and were hoping
and were hoping for a aim of fifty million euros and
and we open to achieve that's by aiming for an international market and a production
and a production cost will we have twelve euro fifty max
of road some examples here of what we can speak about
can speak about what your experience with remote controls
what ideas you have to design a new remote control maybe for which
maybe for which market segments it should be a more should be in all segments
what actually i'd like to handle work to the back to you
What's your experience with remote control
batteries and pour signal
That's that you have a lot of rhode remotes row on remote control yes
The different remote controls for different devices yes
i stay as possibility to To put those buttons behind some other protection so they see
I i have a cell you get in the same size remote control use every day but
use every day but usual buttons as such as zapping their own that's and the volume control only the only possible buttons to use directly or
but not the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television hearing use those
play pause stop
so maybe minimise design the least impossible amount of buttons
So you don't want to bother people with loads of buttons but on the other hand they need
We deciding market will be all people all the pl elderly young people so
if you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only brit and then the cost all the rise higher than twelve fifty I
think the aim is better to use the whole world and britain
the main idea of this remote controls the
that would be when the customers will buy this remote control they already have a remote control which the company's and do with the standards a remote control which comes so with the television so
you don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels we television in those
but then you have to you to find rather remote control if you want so search it's not
but i what it is a impossible to to accommodate all the buttons on this the difference different televisions sets on one remote control it's impossible because
because television sifting the teachers to make ultimate possible for c on one side of the screen and teletext on the other side but just not regular television
number in the most television is the middle
but and they don't use the same signal a remote control because you can use
because you can use a panasonic your remote control on a philips television
the this is always with a universal remotes have to choose to go to use which of
to use which of its type of television you have the so problem
but like the two pages on the same screen like teletext and normal television that's no base standard
with them the most people than will buy the remote control because because
is broken so perhaps they haven't got a all the television so the other option
so the other option is not optional for those people
have to tell you i don't think there's much left it was time to close
our next meeting we'll start will work with early but our next meeting will start in thirty minutes in the meantime
in the meantime it's time for some individual actions
