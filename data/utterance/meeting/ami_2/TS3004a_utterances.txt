know this is about twenty five minutes this meeting
it has to be original trendy user friendly now that's
first we have three steps of making the remote control for the first
very important we have to look what the needs artifact of the functional design and the how the the remote control works so it's very going to look in the functional design is for the next meeting
is what it that so that's the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface we
we have to look what the market is doing for what remote controls are in the market And the third thing is
this is the these are two smartboards use a few years and introduction of that one
Are you ready so all that they share can put things in the red project at four
we have to draw a favourite animal on the whiteboard And
And And say white your favourite animal so
it out and we have to you use a different pen colours and different thickness of that and
roles lonely because otherwise it won't work
Maybe if you hold your pen bit more to the back so
read only have twenty five minutes so
these pens would be just you write it down a downloaded to work you do
You you can You can tie that in the editing read
what we know is that we have to sell this is remote control for about twenty five euros
that's and we have to make a profit of fifty million euros so we
so we have to use a big marketing euro
The production cost about half the price the selling price
So you can't or make calculation about how many have to sell this to make fifty million
so we're gonna first a little discussion about but experience are the remote control first ideas and everything so
my first question was does it have to be universal remote control
Because you sell it only from that and not with the television you sell to a part
I don't think you can buy universal remote control for twenty five euros so
i know where you can buy universal control for a only twenty use h
so you just say it's a universal remote control perfect
And also for the vcr and a dvd player and
the remote controls as a black thing with some buttons on it's
If we control the vcr and dvd player they are within it has to be clear because
your room and the infrared thing it must be from very good quality
we have to make something Like a mobile phones that you can fold it open Maybe then you can
maybe for the dvd pe pi if you just
something on top just don't in general things like volume and the tv channels and inside things you don't use that often
Or or you could the thing go one a small touch screen on the remote control
Why is she to use a touch screen remote control but it's not
There's not a bit too expensive to put a touch screen on it
And we have to care for the strength of the remote control because
because remote controls are most things in the house that falls down on the grounds and you get often broken
And if you have a touch screen in it's f lee two different and
and a lot so lots of kids use it and touch screen is not
You can put gains a new remote control
i'm i my expensive there is a normal recharger
how much is your standards a mobile phone the charger
if you buy it separately from a phone it's probably expensive but
but i what the project the production costs are for such a thing
I if you look at the market it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries and it was minutes to expand
idea because a lot of people are lose their remote control on where it is
Maybe use it as a separate option So that separately
and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge just put it in station or
it in station or you can change the batteries so
I i said something on paper already at size looks usable the buttons on use
has does it has to be have to be like a different form than a normal remote controller
you can I have the basic things on the same place like on off button on top and the tv channels one two three four as a block and the volume want on top so you can see that
that often so if you have a clear button with and a good like on it should be clear as so
so it doesn't matter what place of this on the remote control so you can do something
And what we have to think about two ways a buttons that you used often are Maybe like when you fall it open when
just for the tv and just a normal fashion that's fine
it's out there on top part the basic options on top and if you follow that
when i'm watching tv and just using like five buttons are so
Maybe it's very hard to make it fall open and to that look like it's very a scroll
if you make the folder open its or also the strength is not as good as a normal remote control
No so maybe you have to or keep it like a square this normal remote control
we have to close to sell to finish you said meetings and
for for me the marketing expert the user requirements specification do i need to think as the user
this way if you have to me know if it's for a tva dvd player all the things also
there's also about strain parents five reading
control what do you need a new remote control i already
control i already wrote some know Twenties
