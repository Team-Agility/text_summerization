that's research and development that that before The noses
Whether they be on computer or on the white board or whatever you want
would like to hear about is if we finally decided on or so then g were gonna be using and
so what for the energy sources we can have an a basic battery a hand
a hand dynamo which is which was use in the fifties for torches if you remote
you can have a kinetic provision of energy which
so if you have just a bit of ten to movement that it won't give it the energy to work all you can
But there's sometimes combinations i calculators too combinations of battery with that also using some solar power
these hopes solar panel things so that's where from the sound or can they were from a light bulb
and If we want something fancy the kinetic provision of energy could be
For the case of the remote itself and they can be a general case which is just a flat one you can have
you can have a curved one or double curved one if you
more way gonna make that sits that paul the hands like thing
but then the case material itself so it can be it a plastic or latex or rubber wood or titanium and
or titanium and for each of them you have the cases where titanium you call use it's foal if you if we choosing a double curved case we can choose titanium and if we choosing
and if we choosing a Solar cells then we can choose latex for the case material so we just have
but if we choosing just the flat case then we can go for it thing so
so we discussed earlier on the or at sri problem things so we could
By the tv programmes got one navy of watching
navy of watching imagine that we obtain just lost again it costs very little panels off the wall
Rubber we'll go we'll like that idea you think you can market
After my after my fast and to realise the rubber is more
so you can have basic push buttons or scroll wheels like to have on a mouse
So if you use a rabbit double curved case you must use rubber push buttons So if
and if we choose double curve then we have to go for rubber push buttons so it's
we gonna go we were working with the there's gonna be a rubber case so
if it's not double curve then we've got the choice for the pushbuttons if it's a double
if it's a double curved we've gotta go for rubber push buttons
push buttons instead of the wheel
If it's rubber as an indelible anyways it doesn't matter if
it's double isn't a rubber case mean it's completely fact it fax just whatever they want it to this was
this was the difference between a normal rubber case rubble double rubber double curved case
I love a big mac place
Then you have the case is whether it's flat a curved and
rubber or not but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material So
So if We've chosen role rubber and if now we have the choice for the case where there it's flat single curved or double curved i'm just saying
i'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go then why do
go then why do we need to go for rubber push buttons
so the pushbuttons and sell it can be just simple they can be so that's
with it so the simple push buttons are gonna be the cheapest if we
if we get a scroll-wheel that's a higher price range if we get an
if we get an advanced chip which is used for the lcd The display thing then that's even more expensive
Is that advanced chip on print which up it was one bc And that's got all the electronics one board including the infrared sender
what alternatives do we have to the chip on print
if it's not chip on print and i you get defend chip components and you build them separately and doesn't include infrared it's less expensive
Technically speaking it's know as advanced but that's a job to
if it's it's inside the unit it doesn't affect whether the customers gonna buy it or not
So it's either the scroll wheel all the pushbuttons
The the sample sensor sample speaker thing
We were in the speaker for the remote control unit
it i'm just guessing but it's gonna be the most expensive option probably in
But the speech recognition and option is that it doesn't seem really very promising for us
where you can programme a sample that But when you say something or whatever responding you
or whatever responding you program the response as as just unclips
so you can programme a coffee maker that when you say good morning to it says hello red or whatever but
it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the tv like turn the tv on and it turns on but it's not that it's just
you have changed gives you a verbal response so
like what's the point of saying yellow remote will help for her really
one i said voice recognition them and like channel five and a
channel five and a chance like talk
to it can i have ten of power i have All that forget
so i'll go back maybe to see the previous slide and we can decide
and we can decide for each problem what we should choose so for the energy
so for the energy source to be go for the battery all day
Basic battery cheap
cheap cheerful it's worked doesn't work
Than the case do you want it to facts or curved or single or double curved
so we wanna rubber double curved
so then if we use double curved case then we have to you she used rubber push buttons that's fine
and it's cheap it's still round it sounds kind
also market it as it we're is it stand out you sign
stand out you sign or here in your research and they do have they are they would and they complain about our story and this is anti rsi
the rubber push button so But you have to move your
they would give an option of flat buttons or
He's seeing still get you tell you still get repetitive strain injury when you're pressing a button or pressing a flat the screen it's
But the fact that this rubber it is actually used in these anti rs a way to specific
we're giving them a way to burn off steam
Not that watching tv should be that stressful
And you can for the across the room and try to thirty children
I i tv can be stressful if you're watching sports
gabriel there's some that's a free about the it's the interface
in some continuing with the user interface topic
so i had consulted with our manufacturing division sunday like
sunday like captain was also speaking with them
i also to irises marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration that's
that's crucial as far as what keys we're going to include what buttons we're going to include in another laid out so the manufacturing
so the manufacturing division sent some samples of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products like the coffee machine
So i already mentioned speech recognition interface i
it's just a sample sensor sample output
be probably the most expensive part of a remote without any actual interesting functionality is for is operating the tv
they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an mp three player like ipod
we could have a lot of colours the keys might be funny or play phone some
play phone some way for the elderly where the remote very large and the buttons are very large and there's only few buttons but
So the key layout and design a really crucial you don't want you
you don't want you want people to build a quickly access the buttons that they use lot without was pressing along one and i didn't mention
and i didn't mention we need a power button one or a last give you an example
This is an example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose And for
and my personal preferences if we've all talked about and seem to be on the same page
so was against the speech recognition and against going a pretty new thing in each sense it should be more general
and think the spinning wheel with the lc display or crucial for us and
So is the same was so straight set of buttons
we should have a limited number of buttons ideally it like
ideally it like power channel up channel down volume up volume down the numerical keep that
know colours so secure gimmicky bits to it we not we just gonna
i'd say maybe a couple of colours like like a black with yellow line somewhere like maybe the rr
I i the fact also that we are having a rubber case prevent us from having that cover functional we thought of before
be speak with the button department that that
that that should be easy to have a button it just prevents the other buttons from operating so it should be
and also a recent investigation that we've done in remote control market We have found that
We have found that for a remote control market These are like most important aspects that we really need to which we've already probably
most important aspect is not and feel so that
feel so that what contrast the look-and-feel fancier than the ones that already the we already have so
why should we will buy this one level you got a remote that that serious
settings it should be technologically innovative so
Technologically it should be like Work i it should work
We should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense
in some sense have something that's little more technologically advanced and what's on the market
now it probably is we've already decided that we're going with the that work's already this cheap
is not fancy and it's different but i wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy if
direction and it's not technologically innovative either
it's flat put a blue to use them as a bluetooth remote control and it's got like a because
a because bluetooth is the in thing nowadays like really think Like people
and when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for the don't really care
for the don't really care whether The end of the day whether it works properly or not
a one i suppose and i still first thing you go i wanna buy that gotta love it works or not
good if it looks good and it sickens the speed of decoration
So is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other
It would be that would mean you'd need a television that has bluetooth in it which not no television does
if you're looking at you see looking at something that's going to bolt by people you have to make it you have to make it State of the art
But if wood and apply see connect you if you get a call on your mobile phone but you more mobile phone is downstairs is something you would get on this solution you been called by this person right now
Nah to tell of it the television would have to be a play to use compatible at and there
but we are really keeping to what is already out there and people already seen it people already got it if we want something new
Maybe the kinetic will provision of energy than it's been done for
it's been done for watches of a problem see and that for remote yet
market it never have to change the battery again
And this and this is all time you buy nicely the fact
Do we should think with people so they remote controls about because it charges itself up quite a bit
we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the generating like the energy generator
Third most important aspect it is it's easy to use and we've all
not supposed to look text it's fast and a very much in fruit and vegetables of them are like they have theme for cloths shoes and furniture so
so we can have to use that or like a broccoli key in the another kind key
and so i press of all what i'm saying like move away from the current remote controls that like the look-and-feel of the car ones and Change the look and feel whole still
and feel whole still keeping to the companies and it's like
using the spongy rubber the ritual about that
about that anti rsi and as you squeeze it if every piece is a rising yourself you are charging the batteries And
The power button could be like a big apple
But keep it clean tv claim
used to run what this fda with them at eight of the material for that's material
Bright natural colours nothing
like lime green or bright yellow or bright pink or make
Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and it and that the channel buttons should be one colour and like that you mean
One thing i'm wondering about i hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmick you wrote of having
of having if somebody good because another story they're gonna see like three or four normal remote site a big spongy pink to tomato remote what
Yes the remote control to mark time
what are ninety percent of people can do it
say in this country you'll get lots of people wanting something really funky
Like and kids will be walking in with their pets a or And
Like one break it is not breakable we for a round especially
especially with younger kids they can pick it up and
friendly and also the different families like families as so little
as so little kids and all the could like teenagers will like it specially
specially maybe younger it's in pink the pack a remote control for the room so
so we could do that the pink line is the blue line is the green lines that
So like you walk in a like a remote control because brian and in the shops is that comes out as what colour would you like it and make a look
off it puts even the customer into more control over what the boring instead of you call colours on the on off it so they also get
pressing a like walk into a shop too cynical
that seems to work what products like ipod where you have
where you have a variety of colours that people feel like the customising it wanna buy it just by the fact that choosing
there's some then i wouldn't have that she's an pictures how many people choose that or
as that can be counted of market research thing that's
thing that's easy enough to find out what colours a more popular
From you can estimate you're gonna be working on the look-and-feel design
gabriel you're gonna be working on come up with that the user interface design and
design and by ce two are gonna be working together on this year
on this year we don't have to set the offices
and you're gonna get a chance to play with some clay
come up there for the next meeting be able to come in and show us so my same physical ideas at the moment
at the moment it's hard to work
and see you will be worked on the product evaluation
power and we definitely know Tu-dum still be a simple buttons we're not gonna be done
buttons we're not gonna be done for the new technological chip-on-print expensive things so we keep the costs down it's
it's rubber casing the week and sellers from and funky don't have any other
don't have any other remote controls are the main this Do you
Do you were saying how standard gives you repetitive strain injury this remote control is designs to the complete opposite
it what one extra things other extra things as product have a look
it's We're we're still couple of minutes until our meetings to finish
Disappear it is immediately fact our next paycheck or is that
it's it's gonna be part more of a profit sharing on the product
For buying feet we're getting features and i company
So we really have an incentive to make this remote work
I'd like to share the coffee machine profits because it's really doing
I wanna share in spite stock it is you see
is you see this could be that can only sense so if it were my display ship
This company has its fingers a lot of different parts
where to find out more money making department
mean they told you that they wanted whatever our product to represent the rr brand in to be immediately noticeable
if you look like at the coffee maker at the corporate what page it's not obvious
ro what is to us because we would work here for years and we use a coffee machine but
but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of the company you were running it's just so were in black
And the spaceship doesn't have the ft Keeping in mms nr not on the side of it but
have a sound fashion saying finish the meeting
not telling it's not saying do anything stick it is so maybe you should collect
so maybe you should collect urine offices
