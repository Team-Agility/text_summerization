next meeting and busy writing and b
writing and bc leading the meeting but i
i prepared a little presentation is once again or at least an agenda i
agenda the base five presentation will we on your side
we're at the conceptual design meeting which is you were opened
to make switch it just from the previous meeting placed inside our project folder
today we once again have a three presentations at home right and after that
and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts and just as
and just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that's a great
for of all i'd like to the come in at some of those the things i elaborate something today i elaborate
today i elaborate on the concept what should be
and what material should we used to to make one of those from remote controls
first of all i have that's the structure some of the components is that are used a from what other remote controls form
first of all the case the surrounding all the remote control i'd like to
because it when use a remote control a lot of people we'll i dropped remote control on a break it because
rubber is the best suits poll up material to use for
spots but also possible to create fancy colours wood rubber
wood rubber rubber that makes it easy to to tune that's it's of colour
it's of colour titanium or you have to pay chip and we
pay chip and we have that's it's possible to scratchy or
rubber the total piece of rubber that's or a that's used to make the case is the same colour so if you scratch it
i a hand i did single covered the curved single curved
A bright colour physical forward
it doesn't lay flat down on table but it's
the graphical user interface and the buttons we have some thought about that already
already about the lc touch screen which is
too One of the great the advantages of lcd screen just use and all sex or another as cleaning consulting and
i already as explain some properties of the material and
will be chargeable with an option for mount station so you can
so you can put be The remote control in amount station so that's charges
so that's charges itself lot instead of plan yalina something like that questions
And they should be long lasting not not be anti it's a two minutes or thirty minutes of forty minutes of use Nx
the component that's the makes or transmits the signal to the television
and that was option to use as a in a rather simple chip but i
chip but because for a high in the requiring the requirements they should be an advanced chip in it with
it with also the ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition
the else overheard to the last meeting that they should we should use our own business colours those great one
this is colours it was the slogan and the corporate image so you have
But i don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour
the bike little rr and r and rr on the top but to see
pre boring i suggest because this the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours also a lot of possible colour so that's possible to make very fancy remote controls which you who
In which people will find their interesting and i will buy
and i will buy Not faster when they look the same old grey or black the colours
it as a set the for rubber is it impossible to damage severely the input instead
you use to break it you when you break it to be ease of of purses as of something like that but if you
like that but if you drop it's not broken right away is instead of using plastic hard plastic or titanium
And i personally lights the single curved remote control because
we determine that there will not be no but that's but only an lcd screen so
first there are some new findings in new technology for speech recognition and
and the sense that it you ask you give a question so the device and it
answers you and they already put this in and clean coffeemaker and so that
and so that did you say good morning or a coffee maker and it says that says do you back good morning joe or which made this and this the easy
this and this the easy way to a program that you say record
you say record into the device into the speaker and then you said
a question and three seconds later you say the answer and then
answer and then when you say to question it gives you the answer
useful perform because people lose the remote take a
the remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there But that calls and perfect
it's right to the blc d screen it right and you can draw from
a bit larger it's not really on scale then to work an option
it's a options is the settings of the remote enough to tv and that a thing called cults settings
called cults settings but this is
a remote that shouldn't be given more curvy the remote that's
but and an a bigger for microphone for the speech recognition if you want to implement that
and then if you press the options that so then we have an example of And then you should get the other options that were to what you could do and that's
and it's also we discussed in the earlier that's all of people don't really want to use these extra settings and all the
and all the people but also don't really want to use this this option news so they want to
a you could put an arm and a rooster the scoring device on the side of your remote so you could scroll
Team member This presentation
i'm going to do something about trend watching the trends from the past years what people like audience is like a elderly people liked about shapes colours Material and
I called like what's the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly and young people so
young people so we can keep that in mind for signing for the device itself
the most important thing people like to last year was that the remote control should be look fancy
if we get like lcd screen it's quite innovative so that should be
would only one menu for button channel volume we should also be enough for easy to use
The personal preferences for the young people they liked fruity colours like a banana yellow strawberry red and
the round shapes As soft with the materials like the rubber should be soft
should be soft but if you should the feelings spongy use of sponge bob like face
Elderly people like a two colours which you are be seen in the autumn like them would say the dark brown or red deeper read some they like
they like square shape of round And yes
And hard materials like wood the titanium they those
This is a bit like the young peoples like a fruity colours Innovative all the colleges you blue red white yellow that And then
And then i personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty don't like that like
something and for the elderly people just plain old because we decided to
because we decided to have to remotes to the size or
shapes like a week you said is that's easy better or for the elderly people something like that Like the ipod do something with the round squares simple but
So for the older people are more traditional a four
Colours and elderly people
i changing colours will be easier than changing
Then you'd is the shape of the remote control
But you can find something in the middle ground that square
round corners what's square
Like if you do it the square and round corners put a little in the middle of it i
that's good thing so that's easy choose people know the
Will recognise does the remote control was
Looks something like that you are in colours like red brown they live with a lot of
and that colour and a bit old school style renaissance believe all kinda stinks
so is it a big difference between young
it a big difference between young people fresh exciting and all people
all people all time boring
it's a it's easier to do in colour than a shape otherwise
like i said know people like morse offered as a spongy wants an
wants an old people like a plain wood so we have
Real hard so rubber or soft that
rubber which you can look and feel weird
but you can press it in its feels kinda
its feels kinda spongy
main you can fit the lcd screen in it decide
i also think the can't help but notice there's used you have a remote control would have any l
any lcd screen was a rather small
the buttons won't get that small when a cds green is
But if you put you can put your hand there and then you want touch the screen that's
but if you make the lcd screen as large as the remote control itself yelling you always gets on you
a small because you have how much nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen
use some fat people would effect thinking of press three buttons to say that
japanese people the rubber small hands
you can make it lighted to the there was a dampening A greater feel to push the button
and we want include a pen to point out a we
because if you lose the pen if you lose the pen you can't use
for the screen i how much the actual remote should be that's the
But maybe we have to edit issue to remove degrees from all the thing
maybe i should to should show some points on which we it should take a decision
Are those points Energy question mark how
question mark how much we spy thing with energy
how are we going to be a separate docking station and then
it a chip on print think cases are points
cases are points my coach advice me to discuss here but i hope you have
Maybe it's better to include rechargeable batteries which
the first point we already decided that on the previous meeting
which you can recharge through docking station So
you get some some of those and wireless mice has to be remotes
think normal batteries not like to load to
plain normal plain
know normal plain energy combine supermarket or we chose
The simple rechargeable batteries
so too open with would've Simple yes in the simple the
how does that work with the lcd screen
the chip on print what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button when
button when you get a lcd screen would would not in the buttons are not always on the same place
same place if you're large a button or if you have several options appearing on the screen the colour nations aren't always the same when you do the
same when you do the radio button on the bottom of standbys always on the same place in your own
but the printer enough llc d screen is more advanced than a normal print it so that's
simple sepia where the synch
as easy it's quite a simple lcd screen
d screen they don't need that big of cpu
But the remote control has no way or in the settings menu or just you just wanted to know the volume
you are and in which button you are pressing the right moment
because we're reacting projecting the buttons on the lcd screen
A touchscreen makes it possible to get to go nation of your finger on screen the case
the case or or discuss case we wanna to make it
but the hard part of this or softer rubber
bounces back from the floor when I
shapes it is something between the square shape sit around got on the round shapes
it meets more the young people than older people
Low order for years
how about my idea of making it And one single curve
You could put it on a table what lcd screen you would have
and get a single curved rubber
fancy coloured remote control
user interface are also some questions about the concepts you have some ideas
you what should also have remembered and menu to go back to the first
It if you touch options you can't go back to this the right away the
Isn't it better to have the sound and the channel buttons
on the screen if you make screen for called as matter to
it's easy to have it something like but and minus here the sofa here Minus here here
Channel selection for our one of the sixty eight Volume selection
Volume selection four times an hour
there's but if it's usually plus or men about future of next to each other on a normal remote
The schools it is in the actual design you should know where you
a slow you can make a versus the microphone to
to miss possible to the g you just put in a row underneath it on the bottom of the remote
maybe at the bottom where you can help a whole that with the hand that there's also a microphone
Because it should be important position the people can see it because it is the unique
it because it is the unique the idea of a remote the speech control
look like it's a big so it's it's really an important function of the remote
the like the said like scroll up next to the remote isn't that handy it's better to
it's better to just tie That what you'd like to do on the screen is want to go back it's
is want to go back it's a big button go back if you want to
if you want to see on the settings you press on the settings and goes to this submenu
i do not change a scroll with the menu
most and you can navigate through menu great with the scroll
the scroll cs or if you have a lot of options but if you don't have a lot of
what when you said the settings menu to look up some some channels on your television use is called a scroll down on a menu which probably does not fit on a screen so then
any more questions about the design or the user interface so you can buttons and
different colours but you should have a standard colour
Just a regular a remote colour and then have
but if you use silver the rubber is still the rubber isn't fancy
still a sense of a when use of a rubber is assessing to
to rise to shine and rubber doesn't
Especially when jeanette a soft rubber like this
i would say about like a red yellow green blue just
course the fruity colours And a two colours like reading brown light out dark red and brown
the next meeting is once again in thirty minutes here are
and especially noticed that be in this file design and user interface there are going to work together on for a foundering a smartboard and
and to all four of us specific instructions will be emails why our personal coach
