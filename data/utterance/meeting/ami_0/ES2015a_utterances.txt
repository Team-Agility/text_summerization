And tool training There's one thing that we're going to be doing today
be doing today as was planning the projects how we're going to
as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new remote control
We want this to be a marker will product that can be trendy
completely new styles so that can really appeal to generation that doesn't want a simple plain that channel changer and
and it needs to be user-friendly for maybe if for people that can see the numbers as or
this is a television remote control
Yes it's a television remote control
The way that we're going to go about this is will have a time where we can Come up with new idea it's a loan and then work on the project and then
and then after we've brainstormed in and out but we can come together in a meeting and discuss what what functional design we want to use same
use same with conceptual design and detailed design
One thing that so are we going to do is become acquainted with be that will so we have access to for our project one
and as a team building a moment i'd like us to try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal on the carrot characteristics of that animal
With a microphone so test where but it's a cat
This is the team building time where
My favourite animal which changes all the time
It's really big arsehole you going out of its head
buy a look and it is my favourite animal right now it is a large beautiful majestic feature that
they can really overcome harsh terrain there and
there and although would score just it's also very dangerous because it has strong antlers and
You can really combat its enemies even like it's a terrible bore that to really defend itself
while you guys express your favourite animals
a lot but i like also to animals that further when i'm gonna draw a cat in memory of mine look at that point we cd
doing but that doesn't mean see be not sociable they enjoy a interacting with humans as and
as and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and ready around the outside as
it i reckon then big a list of did that they
my favourite animal would be a talk but i
talk but fish eye feature or i'm That
That i've control talk and cepstral
and cepstral snail a job that i know really if you show
I draw talk at school
a butterfly which is a butterfly yesterday that seem to be like the symbol of springer and is actually pretty is but
and is actually pretty is but if i've ever seen the wild that speak once
wild that speak once call it was like
and then it landed on the wall next to me but this part was a brown
but this part was a brown and then have these big blue dots like this And then a kind is a
And then a kind is a green as a green range and there's
green range and there's like a red one i like this
doesn't know this part of the body was really tall and then i was like the most colourful exotic butterfly have an like once is not
that's pretty on the line to buy a wanna be look at it for about two minutes or we should have a camera
so that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow would seem to say that like spring is finally here
Do you hear the eraser buzzing you do that
the next thing we need to it rests is our financial department to meet our budget
or not need our budget but more but what a selling range will be looking at
at wanna make this As a selling price of twenty-five euros and so we have
and so we have to come up with a way to create a remote control Where
We can Like the price to create it will be significantly less
we'd like to To make fifty million euro something that's the end
one thing we have to think about international used in the design of like different kinds of a vcrs things like that
rs things like that depending on which country you are other thing for the design
we want it to cost absent maximum of twelve euro and fifty cents
so we'll have a ninety percent profit on Twelve fifty
time so that's the time for us to bring our initial ideas any Suggestions that you may have so far and
and Your personal experiences with remote controls and there is you see that's i could be improved your experience with that
I find in the dark it's often hard to know about in your pushing
As find that in a house the remote control always it's always so what
Tracking device of the remote control of some signal that you could find out where one from to them
you can press a button on your wall is it always gets
To use not find that Like there's a lot of buttons on your remote control and you what i have and i
Some remote controls are those a hidden panel it's all those buttons that you don't really use also programming that's useful
so you just have like the number buttons power but in tv video but in
Right anything about the look of the remote control day you might have ideas about maybe it could be
about maybe it could be say like a standard rectangular shape it could be something more interesting like
if it's a trendy original aspect were going for you to design it you think
you to design it you think you can decide what direction you wanna go in but at this point
in but at this point in the first meeting you can be any ideas that we just throw out there
As as if we had having to have it like make each profit out of this it needs to be quite a university except the thing like a novelty thing
thing like a novelty thing my any sell a few things rather than like in general More acceptable but we don't
And key issues here is being trendy original and
times our next meeting will be in half an hour said half
half an hour said half an hour to think about what you want to present or
or not present but bring to the meeting
