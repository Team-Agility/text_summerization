and the project manager chris type of love And
and We speak about this tool would going to design And take to make the project plan Some discussion
has to be original trendy and user-friendly
the important points we have to talk about our it's functional design it's conceptual design and do you say the detailed design
Cn and For that to it we're going it to work individually and then have meeting during all day
for favourite animals It's gonna be not my favourite
characteristics of this animal is dangerous
not pretty small a colour
Just to try to who's the user interface designer According to
So twenty five euro for a remote control
that state aim for the price for the remote control We
And for a production cost of Twelve fifty euro maximum
So any of you have experience in remote controls
yes we have plenty at home my daughter
my daughter likes yellow remote controls we
remote controls children proof of
So she likes the buttons Which make kick so
very brothers to because even if she's not very tall she's the high enough so that when she throw it away it's a
I know from because that nobody has colour for a remote controlled
a remote controlled always black but this one could
lake the phones and these things i at least for children
Should it be these the remote controls where they are would be called a universal word remote control so you
control so you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television then it's the remote
then it's the remote control for the sound system more for your offered you go Whatever
Or if we should have a target the remote control
So colour runs that's easy to use size size
maybe we can change the colour of the accused of three
a menu you can easily moulded the frame
one thing in order of processing this remote control if you remember when people use it to be a bit never find a good but the right place For some reason
place For some reason ddv d day off button when they want to use do So there's a problem
So there's a problem in the design of that remote controls so we
Too expensive for twelve euro

it could be on your screen Which we changed depending on the user or even the user Some i
Some i prefer to have the off button that the top right so i
so i would have my own design of the remote control because it seems like
control because it seems like just a phone touchscreen remote control if you like

left-handed so you will assign left today is like these save director use like this so
The leading anti can keep those features and then we can you make one working
if we want to or universal remote control that we see the pcb for me
But first ten detections you should to do it change channels you adjust volume and animals
but process when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five
And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five
but they keep generally that it's less layers christine and then that's better and then you can put you can only that one but
i change channel ideas that
a given the history of so you could like it and do Present the previous Then
Then you can watch what you're are you can also record your own sequence of actions that becomes more
And we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and
So your personal coach will send you some instruction or forty second
the user requirement specification it's
