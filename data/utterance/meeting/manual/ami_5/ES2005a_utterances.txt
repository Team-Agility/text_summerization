, making a profit of fifty million Euros .
So , it's go gonna have to be pretty damn trendy .
The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television ,
But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For .
, what twenty five Euros , that's about , fifteen Pounds or so ?
my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black .
so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions ,
Because we always lose our remote control .
being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product
What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ?
What speciality other remote controls are having
and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market .
So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things ,
because people really li like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player , M_P_ three player like any electronic devices .
I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky
or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily .
, maybe more like a P_D_A_ , just hand held ,
remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty .
we're k having another meeting in half an hour
, if you could maybe come up with shapes and suggested shades or whatever ,
And , other instructions will come from the personal coach .
Shapes and colours and how to make it attractive .
