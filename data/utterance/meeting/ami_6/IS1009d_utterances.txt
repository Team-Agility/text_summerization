like before we i have to use the meetings from that then the minutes from the last meeting and
R was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface are
Designer i that it looks would be very important on this your remote And
And is to send messages just a tv it would have nine channel
would have nine channel buttons and next but then volume but and stop type of buttons switch to control features scholar contrast rub yes etcetera
Bit of a memory switch a mute but need case the telephone rings us
us beach recognition is one of her very for it favourite personal feature she would like to see to be integrated in this so In this new remote
Should be child friendly design which few buttons colourful
colourful maybe vs star shaped or other shape buttons
she presented also an oversized remote our which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose
But the ray for personal favourite really she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote the industrial designer
the industrial designer presented for the sports on the issue she would like
she would like a special case made out of plastic side is very strong not using any harm for materials should be recyclable and it should be colourful
Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant
She would like to see a time or and or all armour facility integrate it technically
technically this thing would also have a sister and a capacitator diode transistor resonator And if possible
And how it works you press about the chip use a morse code be data to read a east be to that generally it to the generator amplification and
and The circuit board is very inexpensive to build an
an switches things this is a great feature hard to consider
She would like to at this whole thing should be pushbuttons was a simple chip
They're scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore
Should be battery operated And would have to special cases
Marketing expert to our who has to finally come up We just to market this product has been watching the competition has done some research on the internet and also has used for personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote so it should be small Easy to use and it should be eye-catching
From our point of view one is the most important factor is that we should get to market before our competition does
To do with that maybe one or two feature should be double up on which we could call on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on
Too many new features are too many points would on you can choose matter so
so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really given home
it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel she feels that's really
she feels that's really what people want to die
the decision that we talk last time it us that these special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser
Dna she should be battery should be on a chip should be trendy
should be trendy design compact and strong and should
And that concludes to presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting
Now we are ready for the presentation office prototype
me that this is a model of the remote control which we are going to fill up
up this as a as in estimate shape so of it is attractive
up to date and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so
out and also it would be easily fit into a into the hands and you can access all the buttons easy to use
the material which we are going to you was for the keys ease up plastic and which
No the material is plastic and dow for the buttons that's not so soft rubber
because you'd be touching the buttons more so it was soft then you have to
And then now for the led for the light emitting diode it as a fruit was sent to you and it's
And the button buttons part will be explain brief fancy
we decided upon including certain features are the remote these features
these features into what's that dumps it signal to a meeting signal it's the net or in ed didn't read it now and
For controlling the programmes the different channels
We want to include that's two buttons for in pleasing or they can be using the board in
And bm also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels
We have included about that but as flawless and green card and
green card and this is the menu button which will control of the colour sharpness blank yes
No that's a special feature which we have include that this but then
this but then It's an elongated Shaped but there and this is slightly flexible so if we can start
so if we can start to activate it would take to the previous channel if it is down to two words that like it would be to the next round
If you take the user to the previous the next channel so this
the next channel so this is a Swapping back to
The next channel in a numeric pad or
No stopping is if you're you're watching the sake in china and then you go to the tents china and if you want to go back to the second channel you can start this or yes
And and is it this remote as in the twice recogniser which will recognise the use those words and then you to act according to
If you have such a shame that it'll be silly but Are at the request like that
of that you can really hold it in one that you don't need to hands and it's easily
and it's easily reachable even for some of the small
Yes the buttons are all grey east right
The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the
and if you hold it in the centre room and you can you reach it over here so you don't have to turn it a random turn it upside down move it up and down i really
i like the idea that be on off button is a really prominent place that's a really
No these are the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons or yes
So if you're left-handed a right-handed it doesn't matter
And this place the menu up on the screen this brings the menu
this brings the menu on the screen and the orange ones
or and these two are two a scroll the programme channels
Scroll up a scroll on the channel
i will there be an easy thing we number buttons like that people they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what
Yes it could have these buttons we have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons would have so that's yes which can be easily
because we need the symbols we're going into an international market we can have anything with language dependent
but anyway what i did it has to have some all symbols text so that people
Text that we can have on the keys it's a two week that it could
it's a two week that it could be printed on the keys and that's what it is
And one more feature to speak we have all would have for this remote it is an artist a shape i shall shape
and we could have some little comic a factor on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail like that that would that
what are our special features for the marketing that's really the voice
that's really the voice recognition that's really unusual
voice recognition is our big selling point is nobody
point is nobody else seems to have that in this price range
that everybody's gonna say the remote control is practical
To list remote control on the block so we have
so we have to play with the image play with the snail image
play with the snail image
play with the visible and then the voice recognition
And the voice recognition they're gonna be are two selling
but in my instructions it's a response to go to the border to something no
be head looks and voice recognition
the energy source we is say that it's battery right
Sell it right you're trying to change protect that's
just fill in the yellow boxes
the kinetic so that's in the energy source that's all we need electronic
electronic simple chip on print is that's what we using
a regular chip on print no
case uncurved flat it's single curved double curve
Case materials supplements plastic
Rubber because we don't have the soft buttons
Scroll-wheel no integrated scroll-wheel
integrated scroll-wheel lc display
that button supplement special colour
And special material rubber wood yes
my documents computer buy of
financing was pretty simple
Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation
my method for us but the marketing of this thing is first as the big question will itself and
and we should so this prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about
and show the prototype you can see research groups we don't
groups we don't want somebody to suddenly come to listen tell us that this button is toxic and some charles what do we want selling so we have
the things that i was thinking and no but my wish list is really then realised in this prototype i wanted the shape to
i wanted the shape to be bio warfare can do one anything with angles a little square one to be comfy and round d so we've got
that size a small the colours bright and
the colours bright and warm which is what we wanted
wanted to feel to be a soft as possible we'll have the soft
buttons and the way this is shaped even though it's gonna be hard plastic it feels good in your hand so that's
a and functionality of the last i was because people use it but i paradoxically
thought paradoxically the other features in other words the lock the feel and a shape that's what people are gonna get in the story they don't have a television
they don't have a television star they can play with it
with it so they'll be our main selling points so
that's really excellent shape the size is
and these points are an important for the marketing these are in how i feel that
it's the display small have to sell but we're write
to seven and we're right in the middle as far as other competitors At our colour
At our colour it's great colours or bright
colours or bright and warming really do great job there and
and then the functionality you did a really good job on functionality
in the fine and saying that was no room for our voice recogniser
we had what eight euros twenty as i recall
maximum we have another four point three euros so four thirty
But we have no way of presenting that to management and as as a finished product and saying we still waste recogniser are the costs so much
as we know and there's technolo technological world you can do just about anything at any price of the problem was quality so we're just gonna
so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us and
and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway I as we've seen the same
to interrupt that but record remembered that there was no that was not to include it that was there room for any special features so to be we are that
you wanna do is next slide marketing expert
And i'm supposed to present the scale on the white board
where i admit i was little hard on our team here but
Anybody else any other comments or any anything so you feel we should evaluate
Here is what we looking at satisfaction there are room for creativity
Is there more room for creativity or are we up so we happy
so that we could we can just have small buttons and more buttons that is if we want to have more features that
then again if we're gonna do the speech recognition thing we're gonna they're gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the speech so
do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having to mute buttons and
l all this bearing in mind that right now we are within the budget and
we need the we need to leave space money wise for the voice recogniser
So that the question really is how do we feel with the project process so
so there are we happy vs their creativity at has passed a euro war
a euro war we're not happy with a new product we create it all that was created
personally i'm pretty happy
And then the next question is are we happy with the leadership hope this project
a means we used to use the whiteboard we can use digital pen digital pens
pen digital pens are are these things
call that it's maybe not in the best position in the room
and push it may be all had slides presentation was made a little easier
did we knew a tv find new ideas we get
Today we have apple juice left we sell all the million of what we have said
feasible from the production point if you and feasible former marketing point of view
