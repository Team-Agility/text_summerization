before i start with the meeting has a few things to tell you about the setting we're in because
because we are are being watched my big brother so
camera settings so we don't have or laptops in front of the cameras
other that will be done with a tool training in the u these two smartboards Then the project
and discussion about that and a little closing at the end
wall so i'm the project manager which one
And you go on top so i'm the user interface
i'm the user interface design
none of a fruit or a i'm the industrial designer
tenth any my function is some marketing expert
the aim is to make a new remote control and maybe
and trendy it's two things really are close to each other but at same time
but at same time user friendly and they have
stages there's functional design so
because at the detailed design how or two we go up to begin are really about how the bit to techno of it's it's possible technical ones
it's states is is broken up into two stages individual work in a meeting so it's
the tool training we have two smartboards this one is for
this one is for the presentations the powerpoint presentations work presentation of one of you you have
this is called the smart board
and as you a third the darkness in the shared folder can be showed on the screen not really and then might joke and so if
joke and so if you wanna show something put it in the shared folder
it This a soap very straight to afford with the say to print the younger the blind to select pen
At the white board on the left Every every one of us most draw our favourite animal And
And tell that was why we add that chosen that animal
important is that we use different colours and different pen widths why it's yes
this exercise the company board tell it to do it or did
of fun than before we did begin really do the hard that thing
which is there were drawing or favourite animal
do that touch your hand on this little thing easier that's an
seconds is not forty real time so
the phase because we have two and twenty five minutes so we
Remember you use different colours and different pen widths
So choose or coloured shoes
choose or coloured shoes
choose or coloured shoes and with and draw
You don't have to change the colour and the pen with ensuring but rolling or
You have to scroll push hard on the pen right
red hair so it must be red
It's the inside is you'll be finnish citizen
And then you have the current colour you can change
Sonoma red or green
the big lines were or like mine
we have a dark a few years ago and then and
graphical user design issue
pick the wrong a function One job
So you can see is really really easy problem to use not difficult
after a cat a turtle in the dark
And can design a remote remote control out of all
with the interface might be easy to have to draw here and display there
be easier but at the other hand a pen like there is easy to hold in your hand
like like all here drawing and then displaying on screen not
Is that the white rat if it's the white rabbit
it's the white rabbit from the matrix
it is isn't prima good impression of all rabbit
i figured out that was actually the box to impress
The selling price for the remote will be at twenty five euro
euro and the production costs may not be more than up twenty and a half euro so
half euro so from my point
from my point if you i don't think it's the gonna be very very high tech high definition all from a turn remote for twelve fifth at twelve euro
the probably must make with the new remote is fifty million Euro so that's a lot we
a row when the selling price twenty five you can't two million to me remote but our marketing
but our marketing rage is a market rate is international so we have
we have for jury the whole world we can sell
you can think about experience with remote control yourself that you think might
what what can distinguish or new trend remote control from all the others
what's the most important thing at the remote control
the most important thing of a remote controls that you can switch channels and
so another remote control which can can be used for television and dvd and radio and or just
all drawn scroll there at the left
no when it is in word and you have stated in the shared documents folder you can show their
i have some points from marketing point of view
just a standard think about things like intuitive small fairly cheap that's pretty cheap
that's pretty cheap twenty five euros brand independent
brand independent it doesn't have to matter which brand your tv or
most of the remote current remote controls are just for one purpose and
and by make a multipurpose it But as a new feature it as a new feature to market and distinguish
and distinguish from from current problems
i rather find it very annoying like when someone is standing in front of the tv they can switch it
Think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth
that We're on a certain channel you can see on the lcd screen what programs are coming up or
it must be really innovative technical wise
at it you got some cheap remote controls
But when you enter a new market we remote control and
at beginning of such project it's it's very to talk about this would be that would call that but we must
but we must not lose side of the user friendly
I anything about the user interface or Design
next meeting will start in thirty minutes so
individual actions i assume a will be some feedback via in the middle
the industrial designer has to look at the working design
the user interface designer has to look at the technical function so
A few we could get back to the next meeting action
Make some mark up some general ideas and then we can plan
But maybe because you are working on the user requirements you're working the technical
you're working the technical functions we are
do so you don't come over we'd use requirements we don't fit the technical functions
if the technical functions have to be designed governor know for what kinds of issues it will be or do we use it
But the option leave the details
it should have really in a individually this thing what's at his point of view is the most important and
and and then are we going to fit all the pieces together the next meeting I'm saying
you were it will receive specific instructions by your personal coach i see we have
