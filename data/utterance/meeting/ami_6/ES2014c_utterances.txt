Conceptual design meeting Right
to so maybe and Quick summary of the last meeting Quickly give you What we what we had
Right so we have the fact that we're gonna have the little uncomfortable it's a colour scheme corporate it on to the A device that will device we had
we had a a decisions about to Maybe decisions about to The voice is also it's gonna
voice is also it's gonna be simple to make it let's complete president trying we're gonna have a
we're gonna have a thirty two pages front page
front page which at the features that the the customers most wanted and then
and then the the backup features on the second page So that it could to You the technical requirements and the customers when have
before we still have the user interface which is all the buttons for dinner in corporate then
i'm not going to my findings in each of these areas phase the
phase the power supply we have the option that's just a standard battery
They've you think you can like the guilt which is which you wind up like an idea
which they have you seen this see what she's wishy you power by way different than which has more money from we should mean
Wishes you and you mouse going to send section which can scroll up and down would be for the volume
Do that one issue for the buses is depending on which material we use if we use rubber
we use if we use rubber buttons and it requires a rubber case so we
as the wasn't too much difference in the cost but the race the actual buttons but
the actual buttons but does affect the printed circuit board there's next
for the circuit board which is the middle this see them that the chipset things of the still of the remote The
The thumb supplies a simple a regular and advanced and circuit board and these different
and these different price is going to reach to forgot the scroll
to forgot the scroll wheel for one of the buttons that would require a slightly more advanced say cobalt and if we just have the standards and push button
one final think we can move for some information the speech recognition is the small
is the small unit available through the company we chose you would be to cost between the
between the side the size of the remote too much and
and i that would require more fun stick a poster is next
a poster is next a price in a sense that is as
that is as an extra cost nonsense and there is what this preferences
and there is what this preferences As a policy for how we could use kinetic and
and which the idea of the watches and you move the remote around
move the remote around to power that and it's
and it's weird to avoid but she's running out of place but she's and so it's like
for the past since i saw we put we go it's having the standard pushbuttons of them the scroll wheel
and for the circuit board again depends on which features we want a national minimum wage to
wage to be one of the scroll-wheel the one the voice recognition that we'd have to get a more costly circuit board That's it
Joe with a printed circuit board you were going for the
pens i forgot the speech recognition we'd have to hold again the vance from guessing but i that's
So we want to make that decision now in the sense that this is the point at which were discussing that issue so
and then make decisions going back to these presentations is that where you have a we would be
and then make a decision at that point in time
there so if we wanted to know it The scroll through required a regular and what required and downs and therefore able to see that then we could make a decision on that point and that be the
Bless you want to put it back in the euros
As say they only specified that we need to move and say a couple of the scroll wheel didn't
of the scroll wheel didn't the voice recognition
the voice recognition came a set of peace for information and
One scroll through required a regular so the
if you feel it down This this but the ball much of highlights it but the scroll
it but the scroll requires the main minimally a regular chip which is in high
The display requires an advanced chip to display
chip to display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expensive
And the pushbutton just requires a simple chip so i would keep the price
if all of a sleek and sexy a scroll wheel is maybe a bit bulky i have got
pictures seen pictures within the state of the side of it and the jury look great
To maybe simple push button and that would cut
simple push buttons
Simple push button
So we go for the simple push button and like that we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we're going
And if it's just the push button and use simple circuit board
but we have to do you call them at l elements into consideration and
and so there is one element that requires a lot more expensive one orbits in the regular one or the more advanced than that would have to be the same for all of them so
I suppose we need to find out what circuit board that requires maybe for many did they make a decision
But the way that i interpret that it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly it just
it's like a power just apply deal message so i don't think it
so i don't think it would affect our circuit board
so we'd have a simple circuit board and i'll be an extra
circuit board and i'll be an extra up in addition to make sense
i don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with that the example
the example of a given day is good morning coffee machine good morning joe it might be
that makes sense so we stick to the simple circuit board and then think the
board and then think the speech recognition is next it's a possibility
circuit board simple
board simple push button
Is anyways the base to have some ball bearings inside is
is is someone watches which you you shake to power that somehow mechanism
somehow mechanism inside house a few movement so you'd miss
so you'd miss the remote around little bit and then powers up
speech recognition know as a record
do is i didn't affect the circuit board just the fact is
I had speech recognition requires announced or
speech recognition you recommend is so simple and so we
text of May we may will find out how much that those cost and that's life i realise that
And then have to change i change our everything the last minute
From out of the remotes out that the minutes in on the mall particularly sleek and sexy
a buttons some of cases that you can see just size as an old
right click during go on to the previous slide
some of the remote i looked at one of the models that did actually have voice recognition way you cut Where was connect to the remote control functions on that
model way it can control four devices tv cable satellite radio dvd would feel so
of thing and just to market it as a completely different Like different viewpoint is the fine you lost control rather than
than trying to compete with the functions the scroll buttons
the scroll buttons as you've already mentioned There's examples of the was put that to look
we have one page and because it impacts on all the on the materials that price it's not great
that was a specialist had a remote that'll cut think about
way they just had a very limited range of buttons and the
of buttons and the walk upright colourful and
Or to go for the international market rather than a local market that
market that wouldn't necessarily preclude the one thing
the one thing you can often do with products is you can a small modifications you have
modifications you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever and
you have more the one model to the model three and a half or you can
and a half or you can subdivide your market up but
we add on for an extra package go on this basic
go on this basic what i'm right in that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that so
here and that so you would have for future reference the possibility of adding an extra features the extra cost To take care of specialist market segments
because it's already i'm very good voice recognition technology out they because i was might not cover the same functions that teleconference to might be good idea to market has the find a function
The fight find a function
find a function rather than as a speech function to find your remote
Just as for going for the international market that's so maybe a lot of people my know like the speech recognition So
So you have a finder feature or than voice recognition feature in your turn
and you don't remember scroll buttons
i think we've decided not to it's gonna increase the cost and give know
cost and give know we all ten extra benefit and
extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the thickness of it
and just to be a way that are kinda specialist functions and specialist remote ball would
ball would probably do we want to focus on those like such as the children true
does a mention just as a wall and about what the design just to avoid
So the example of a say you volume buttons for up and down that might both have a v on for volume
in flip it around and i disagree a hundred eighty degrees another up and down and upside-down
So that which of the volume was going up but as the one underneath it see the volume and
the thing was soft If you decide to do this to have triangular buttons somebody might look at this one and see all this triangular button is playing up i'm not suggesting
all no them i see them i see this playing down right that's gonna turn the volume down where is
where is the actual buttons point nope so the functions that and what not
So be careful what you put on the buttons in the case for the shape
in the case for the shape that you make them because it might be kinda
because it might be kinda to you Contradicting kinda shapes
volume up volume Volume
to do is to have a sizable by of information on a limited number
limited number of buttons it was sixteen
so what's a decision on them to design of the volume button
I've i've got something say about possible design things from Trend watching
Right A bill of years and trends In in icsi fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market the
the one that's what i told from last time that we it's a device people
that we it's a device people about remote controls what was good about what was bad but they used and
and we've also they're looking at fat so the fashions of what people are wanting of can see because at the moment so
at the moment so that people in paris and milan watching the fashion trends So
So to summarise the most important things which can live remote control market investigation the most important thing was the
the most important thing was the things look and fell fancy relevant as functional and
And the fashion trends are the people want clothes and shoes and things with the fruit and vegetables see that
that the feel of the material should be spongy which is country
which is country to last year partly should be must
We need to emphasise a fancy design this on a remote control above all else and then also try
which could be a find the thing with the hand clap and then we need
so perhaps few buttons and functions as we've discussed and then
and then maybe find a way to incorporate this trend so this is a catchy people's imaginations So maybe
So maybe we could make the buttons shape like fruit and veg should all
maybe we can make them of rubber rather than hard plastic and then
and then cities mark it and that we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote say
remote say in the shape of a pen on all something like that
How how far we actually want to go along and so to follow the trends do you think the trends
do you think the trends ought to take important for this type of catching all
if you start making the buttons fruitshaped it might make it more complicated to use
you were just talking about you've gotta be careful about how you shake your buttons you
your buttons you gonna stay right people on i would've thought
on i would've thought the functionality that people get teased off by a thing i haven't instructions except right so
button see the stand-by button is quite kind a separate from all the other functions maybe that could
that incorporates the trend also the same time not confusing people If you're looking for functionality
i maybe fruit vegetables maybe popular but as
popular but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are made it
that if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit days next year's that was the animal the relevance or whatever that means you're
that means you're we change your production as usual and
I'm not i'm not but the time scale with thinking of selling the product of errors i
Me to see is really see the remote control market isn't a thing which takes in These kinds of fashion trends they're looking for something
We we can maybe can apply a fruit shape of it
Maybe store the rubber design weekend
With that and this other fashion sense that this is what was the spongy feel was that to to fashion it was wasn't
It seems that you can have rubber case as as buttons
And i you can make them curved or double curved and that would
a lot of things so if you have robust as a new heights have rubber case
of use rubber double curved case any message or buttons also and if you have the rubber
and if you have the rubber casing of a rubber buttons it with the
Number buttons require rubber case
A dolphin with what one button for the spongy feel have everything about
the main problem is and how frequently do the fashions change
change in a sense and the production you want things to stay if you want
the men if you got Fashion changes and you're incorporating then it means that your stock it is this last year still i never use only are
i never use only are having to sell at discounted rate which you would want to do whereas if you
to do whereas if you get the product the same but you could have a difference from here to here and seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like rather than changing the whole get double you just changing
you just changing one aspect like the stand-by button like that and especially
As as you may be a limit to the far east los put the logo on the shall we will never know whether or not
we are of a second or find a fairly quickly when you move or at your kid modelling stages to where How much but how much but i hope liable is plasticene
Maybe think of the cases like change with the fashions like the nokia
like the nokia phones we could take the case enough so i
So are you talking about to changing Changing the casing
outside so the buttons was the inside and the channel
and the channel function of the most of time do you could change the
could have all we still that would have to have the roll call on if we knew case we could have like
we could have like in cases for kills and red ones something for
minutes left i whether mobile phones instance and blue some in rates and rather than alan black or we know
we are supposed to use company colour scheme haven't really seen
because you could have your company overwhelming to be finishing
so what you would all you would really need whether the whether the casing beep or any colour could be any colour but that bad should we don't have to stick out on top of it so that
so that scenes with the like that because it's a lovely back read the only colour that might not stick action by long would be a quite casing
and the way they've got that they're even if you had a lot of light which is the predominant colour of the the windows bad you still be able to see it clearly from wiki same route product so
We went with have a big enough market to have this can like second you marcus allen the cases Might be some to consider
if it's for young people like phone generation that's what they put it put on the market research
on the market research has been on that side of things that
it's people's say that it's the lock they want a fancy looking think
i'm not convinced or whether having changeable covers would be something that people buy into with about files
with about files It's the it's an indication device to
where you keep the remote hit the syphilis that's fine
so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case
So we don't change case changed his
It would decide on the rubber case the spongy
case the spongy feel it would think
feel it would think that might call as a trend
last year the trend is different last year partly is not
change i whether it's from those things that Like having all fruit shape the keys that probably would go out of fashion very quickly where it's just
If you're going for fashion trends that they need you to have the interchangeable cases so
door otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote island just a case
Here at this is my sense of it which spent stick with the standard the case then
standard the case then have the standard rubber buttons as
really talk about the curvature of the keys as far as the
as far as the single curved and double
single curved and double curved
Maybe cares get the like so the more you feel the double
the double curve would require us to perform miracles the plasticine
The remotes out of cost cr
one thing to consider is that in some way if you want having a fairly standard case it means we can all fit together on top of each other there for storage
other there for storage propose is a shop so makes it easier dick and if you stop until we said was if you
said was if you do fancy things what do you think or put it in a cat have a packaging box that does that And
And the cost of packaging could be quite important easily the total cost of the product
so it's a grieving just work out war it's either we have to
that so i if double curved it's maybe it comes up slightly
maybe if we're meant to be fashion some meeting in that manner so
go for single curve just a compromise
curved or double curved so it's single curve
This is do we decide on the kinetic power supply line
i would draw really know much about the cost a normal creativity but
way they have a simple circuit board just to keep the cost on the i
and the voice recognition we can use call it just to find it at the circuit board
And then we can one button shaped like a fruit Perfect
So we'll spongy feel buttons as as we as as
it's rubber buttons is not only spongy feel buttons as rubber buttons with
an apple would be a good recognisable she if you start
if you start and end to can all be jeans and things you get that we have
so what we should we making this number button Apple
a for that it quite big one as this big apple
i wanna incorporate bit of call it if one wants to find
can work on keeping the bus things like a simple decide
seems pretty straight-forward small some would just be
just to keep the shape of the buttons simple
it's a shape of the buttons simple
go in addition to run plasticine defeat or whatever so
