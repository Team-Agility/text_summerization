You hit home is the pm
I believe me said ten tell is with this as in the control room
it's that low again always late Point don't
i have some points i would like to some issues that would like to point out
First of all if you make minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
the second thing I was that was thinking to myself i have this little remote control and talking to it but it still need to points to the television because it
are there any pre discussion questions
then the decision on the remote control concepts and
and the closing forty minutes
forty minutes total for this sell
we can email is immediately start with the individual presentations the programmes you made
because i understood there are some significant changes in the market situation
Ease of use it is important but innovation
And that fancy look-and-feel is even more important and some
and some fashion watchers found out that the young target group like fruit and vegetables In their clothes shoes and furniture and that
the older group a step further dark colours simple shapes from the material but
the material but we're since we're cost reading room The younger group
the field machines is spongy
so what do you think When fruit and vegetables are important for clothing shoes but they are a remote controls also
a shame they just want something colourful not specifically an apple as a remote control something
No i the younger group likes a more colourful but
i suggest that the corporate colours are great and yellow I hadn't
a cable go back to that slide the
and the feel of the material has to be spongy
but personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control but
Maybe some soft material but not real spongy
and like the older group like from a materials but that doesn't
but since we're going to cost rating on the young group
like cell phones which exchangeable cover
You can make if you've very colourful ones and a very traditional call cover
I'm thinking about the banana a telephone telephone from siemens the yellow rubber telephone it's a rubber
You have to fruit you have to colours We have to simple design
the light blue and it's also a yellow
the important findings are innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group and
and colouring is important and soft materials
important but technologies twice as important and what was
add a Because most of things we already said in The previous the discussion
the previews i deserve voice recognition and the round buttons for the channel programming and volume a few
a few interface i find an internet so are these
but they're very as far as an a very high-tech and just or weird Shape So i suggest
i couldn't i had a small mark up for signed on the close eye But it didn't
work but then didn't load the information so
so i made a really simple for us shape on in the Powerpoint but we could make
but we could make it around to an oval remote control a yellow
a great this is how you hold a remote control
What did he have something like the siemens phone it's rubber so it's
there are there also remote controls who have a little shape than a way you can put your fingers and so you can get
in these interface we can have a high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
and all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and one
So is that the voice recognition you can program like thirty Where'd you can controls on that
that because there are a song possibilities in some in possibilities
i had a talk with our manufacturing division and
and we had a talk about all the different components wire in this design these are
and use a web to find my information About
About casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved
have the uncurved or flat case that's the most common remote can control form we used to
it's curved in two dimensions you have to imagine
you have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form so it's
and we have an even more advanced a shape which is curved
i don't think you can compare the little bit with the big ray image you have in your presentation the big remote control something like that But it's quite
and forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic
we cannot use the titanium on the double curved cases and these
and these latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cells as energy so which source which brings
source which brings me to the different energy sources
we even seem to have handed and dynamos for powering our remote controls you really have
but it's a rate roll worst i
there's also a kinetic energy supply so
when you're watching tv when you have to make some energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it's against the wall wanna do with it has
it has to move that's the sense of it and you can store
if hook onto that the kinetic thing is very funny the
but it's your calculator as a solar panel and hand dynamo
But if you're watching a movie how many times you take the remote control in and if the
if you have a watch you have the kinetic idea know what's also you
but from your own watch you watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of energy then the shaking of
the shaking of your body which is all was every actively make body shake it charges its but
its but the problem here is that it's supplies at the very little amount of kinetic energy so
so you have a problem when you're watching a movie and you haven't move the remote a remote control in the in an amount of time Any wanted to switch the channel
So but maybe there's a possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries so
and mine doesn't have kinetic energy used kinetic energy and all the wise use the
because i the voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power
and we that the traditional solar power which is
which is just a piece of material on the remote control which Transfer those lights energy into electricity The user interface controls
The user interface controls
wheels and these scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons so
buttons so it's just like a mouse you can score one
and d indicators we have the lcd displays which means
which means you can watch in a display or which channel you have chosen like that often the amount of volume which is currently and
and we also have double scroll buttons Which are just
so we don't really have the button we had in mind thing or and the last meeting the thing with the rounds of the four
we can just make four points buttons in a form of around
think the scroll wheels i also have some information about a two I
I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll wheels i'd
see at any a scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it
Maybe menu integrate some functions
What about Integrating a scroll bar on this side
A flawless Think about a scenario where you would use the scroll button
it you buddy means is there's an button integrating the scroll wheel there's no scenario
there's no scenario way you use at the button in the scroll-wheel you just use
am i this is my volume button and either on the side or the side
And click it should mute and the device
And and it makes it different from the traditional devices on this market so
do it what do you think about a scroll bar the scroll wheel
the any other devices like at telephones and are radio pocket radios we use this
all the sony telephones use it for volume no i
no i said it's not really a scroll wheel but on their side that the volume button is on the side because
believe it if you have what we've already said the grip a places in the remote control you have your hand on one place on a remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb So in that case of
So in that case of the volume button on the sides a of remote control would be perfect
we have to note if you want to use these rubber double curved get a case you must use used by should have pushbuttons there's no way
there's no way you can integrate lcd displays there's no
cd displays there's no way you can integrated scroll wheels because
scroll wheels because it's all curved there's
it's all curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate these things so
use and these chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular
we have a simple regular an advanced chip and there is something
and there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker which
in the voice recognition you say i were you can program words like volume up Of newt that's a mute
you program it you musically you give and And action to it's that's really the mute function and
and when you speak in the remote control it's repeats you're saying so
that's the sample sensor so if you say mute
and then you piece of this action with which you believe it is you use a mute
any it makes a computer sound mute and then goes
so that's the voice recognition item we were searching for this sample
this sample sensor requires and regular chip i fault
if we want to use the lcd display really need the advanced version which is a bill
version which is a bill little bit more costly if we want to use
if we want to use the scroll wheels we need the regular version and if we don't
and if we don't want to use any of these more sense functions we can keep with a simple a chip which is a bit cheaper
doesn't look any tv can view it did it on the on screen
my conclusion unfortunately the market is decide as a little older than
the market would like something titanium casing but they
i've chosen the more battery with solar cell solution for the energy it's more
the kinetic thing it is it's possibility is more sense
But what about markets want colour false designs so if we use
was an lcs ids at this is what this is my personal preference but i bet i understood
but i bet i understood that the market is different so
the younger people like soft material
these scroll wheels they can be handy so
And it can be implemented with the regular chip
else we already need a regular chip for the sample that's as we know
so if you stick with the simple as straightforward and not curve design and it's too dull i don't think they are
it and if you take the double curved then you can that's you can only use the rubber buttons you can as you scroll wheels so i
what about The issue i addressed at the beginning of the meeting the voice function we with the infrared issue Because it's
It's it's imagine it's very goal to talk to a device with you have two points to another device it's very
The most infrared remote controls don't have to be point that
right but if you have carpets on the wall which are natural of mean friends probably do have then that it might be a bit more of a
Yes because the walls the reef like the infrared light so
i suggest we use the sensor sample the sample sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip
And and the scroll scroll wheels
I like the scroll wheels idea
an escape skip the lcd part i don't think it
according to read that the market likes new fresh technology and lc
we are not very what we did not know and much about d that the financial part that's the problem
because if we do have enough space in our finance i would say do integrated because
because It it at the little x extra high-tech feeling to it
They always have the scroll wheels that's the speaker the speech recognition the rubber The fancy colours
on energy we decided chip
The case and rubber with one curve User
But you can scroll is work with one one curved case
work they cannot work with double curved has this
then the corporate identity should be it in the product i that
the next phase source and is the design of the look and feel The user interface design And for
i'm your personal coach will give you more information on that and
and the id and the uid need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
it's a when we come back in thirty minutes you will have a prototype or a
so can you gives a summary of all decisions with nite
The casing is curved single curved
Traditional batteries and solar
just the energy source is the batteries and the solar
and we should use the company colour something like a red of black and yellow
grey in yellow or black and yellow
Yellow case and grey buttons
yellow but i could think of a more attractive a set of colours
i was more thinking about the fruit colours that the that show just before
these colours are really what are young people are looking for
be two colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image or
Thinking into colours is to back and white forearm i had a market group i
but i'm afraid is not possible to print a picture or the size because
Just week ago keyboard manufacturer with friends it's fine
Yes but our manufacturing department is not so it stands it's a techniques to actually very slow
The scroll wheel yes the voice recognition we
the voice recognition we already decided
scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons i and
But then you just have to the fact that that runs on the buttons will disappear eventually
What i said in in the first a discussion the digits six on the bus and it will disappear when it's from rubber
but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case
But still then if you feel lie if you feel your remote control you just rub on the cover so you're up on the painting
it's possible because our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing so
we should have the other way around i a plastic cover with the rubber finishing this is this
this is the finishing this is what's on the edge what you feel but the
but the fronts On which the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber
what you want because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel and that's what you get with rubber
so if you want a spongy feel you need to to make it buttons all of rubber
decide exactly the sideways the side but do you touch
the side but do you touch between the These buttons
especially when there aren't a few buttons on it you have a lot of space and to touch so you just
i you to have to figure that out i'm going to leave a decision
you have the most knowledge about the suppliers the possibilities and
what about the chips we use the regular chip
with those regular chips we can still control advanced functions the chip
The only difference between a sense than direct the versions of the advanced a version of the chip supports lcd that's all and we've decided
and if you bright anything down could you put it on the shared folder
