So so we have forty minutes for this for the second meeting or we have
last meeting so show the show them to
so that's the of the points we had last meeting was should be you universal remote control now that's
coach and it should be a tv remote control only so
it still has to be of our remote control for kids no it's
the the main people of interest of this company are forty plus people so
people so they're all and not younger people
especially all people might be bigger buttons
i've Use the marketing report from other side
and i have i'm from ohio services and the other side
it was a A report about an experiment with a lot of users And
And they had a lot of findings in the report with the statistical thing that statistical proof And so
i i had three pages with findings and so a lot of a lot of findings so we can use this
so we can use this to create a round remote control seventy
seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly
we have to make a beautiful remote control
control eight percent use would spend more money when a remote control would look look fancy this
this fits at the what time if you set about the older people older
older people will spend more money for something what's good because
good because the younger people are more critical where they spend their money at
sixty five persons the city of persons of the users said they zap a lot
Yes fifty percent of users say
fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons at an
that and it maybe our fall open system is a good one but
if you have to ten percent on the top ten year
ten percent on the top that's a good
a page two remote controls
two remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room that's
the room that's exactly what we said about maybe a home station for for it to to recharge the batteries
system so when you clap your hands it will beep you
so Remote control beeps mean like that button on stage
it takes too much time to learn how to use are the new remote control
one because if we make a wall new product or own style be we this is so difficult a difficulty
The next remote controls are bad for rsg
but only if they zap a lot and the watch over five hours tv i don't
the last experiments was about gadgets like the speech recognition we didn't
and an lcd on the remote control we already
that they finally have a conclusion that younger people in or a nature for forty five for more interested in new features and but there
And older people want to spend the more money on that
But you did you already said that the company was about of forty plus crimes
so we just can skip the lcd u on the remote control because
I we can speak and we can skip speech recognition directly because
directly because it's not so reachable for twenty five euros
good because i told about television dvd players t real and vcr had a question about
my point is if we made make remote control for only television it's hard to sell it for twenty five euros but
on the market you can now buy for twenty euros a remote control for everything and
so we mow them be made a mess made it make it a very special
be simple because of the rid the elderly people and it's to use it
and that's the motto we are a reference to for our our style be
The company's about are their own fashion their own style
the main thing is the usability that's when we can make it a special product
technical functions design
elderly people so we need to keep it simple the way i want to keep
the way i want to keep it simple is to use to send the standards So standardise the methods like a know remote controls not
a full like your it's already said only ten percent is being used
the next phase but the us a basic functions like numbers and that
and for other people big buttons and
a way to find out what people use maybe just use questionnaires on the internet or
Just ask some random people elderly people what they use what they want on remote control
One down of functions i could think of volume channels the basic a call that number but This one two three cetera the text there's options basic on off and find
text and always have to pick a number but
but if you could make a new option that she uses press one button you get
but then you have to remember what favourite it what channel so
i would find it and it when you just press one button and you get a six
but How can you remember what channel connects to what favourite but
what i was reading on a page remote control just sends come on space six months to to television so
and if you make favourites can say six in a row just numbers
but it for user to remember if i press that button it goes to that channel
but isn't it hard to remember like favourite one
me it's if i use my telephone i never use those buttons to call should never
maybe elderly people no rights
play pause i if that's usable when
missed did i miss any other buttons those buttons
Like a web browser back button
just use when you wanna switch between channels all time
Now do you want to do it like if you have the channel above ten normally you can press one
it a special all the plo eight people use standard buttons are you have that
button just one pressing on quickly of each other
Just skip simple standards features
but wouldn't it be a problem to because you have to be fast enough maybe the elderly
stripes so you have like at five seconds period to press those two buttons
And what also is it's not the remote control that that makes a tv do want to which the t
to which the tv who depends that's mostly two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must to type one or so
So if you have a universal tv controller you need that one button that has to stripes to have
to have a period of an five seconds to press the buttons and that know for elderly people to look one to press and a man
But do we still need it to level a remote control because
of banana what are the most things in modern tvs are also on the menu so we
But we can integrate that volume and previous the next so
And you're at a really have to divide between functions you often used like maybe switch channels and volume and that things and the menu button because you in
you accepted use a mute button to
if we should stand out unique we have the design
so when you are in the shopping is cr or a tv control hanging that it stands out but just in a
but just in a row you see All the same a remote controls
Maybe we can give it out in different colours you can choose blue
you can choose blue or yellow
You think you can't make it a few control too small then you will all of them always lose it
The method i used is search the web just web page provided
then the circuit gets close by pressing the button the like a switch And
And by closing that certain circuit chip knows what button is pressed or
pressed or like you press the one that circuit it's clothes and
then the chip produces a pattern Like a morse code to
that's the lights emitting diode
and the light emitting diode is producing infra-red lights that's and
because it's if you use it screen on read through green
Red so it shows that like something's wrong and
almost remote controls as read so
You have to do all the whole remote control becomes a green if you press a button that's
That's if the screen green or red or
And and the receptor in the tv senses that's room so we
that's room so we have to understand what buttons are used to to make it universal so
the chip for is producing the pattern so
And automatic only search function for each television
i use universal Remote control and
and a moral on you you type search and to do that began
and i have to a short time the television turns off and then you
we have to make as a bit more intelligent chip then the standard one because
that's when the circuit as close to produce is the pattern but
but it for brands of tvds patterns are different
So like when you press the one on one tvs call the one and
idea that can be done by just could change changing the spectrum all the time and
What he's doing when use configuring the spectrum just chip is trying to switch off the television and
and when it's switched off you can push a button as it's working now so and then you say
it the energy source is the battery
the subcomponent is one I it is the button pressed so
when you press a button to switch get close
And that's connecting to it chip so the chip knows
so the chip knows what button you pressed
And the chips sends out that's our to the infrared bulb and then put
buy this one this is a normal ball so the normal flashing lights
but this one's producing infrared light this
infrared light this invisible and
invisible and this one's producing normal light
we can make the normal one also a normal light not led light doesn't know
because when you button to press a button and it doesn't work you can
if the battery's low all your homework so you have to indicate
Maybe you have to to put a small light around the button you push so you see green
so you see green if you push the button
or may be on top of the green lights flashing or
The same as a telephone a mobile phone or what you mean if you wish
thinking about that on a mobile phone in the dark
It lights up everything light set that's a good it is
Everything lights up buying that on a remote control
it a mobile phone the phone can do it
Maybe we'll also the on the on the station a button to to call your remote control with the beeps
but maybe it's that's the real too hard to make Especially for that kinda money because it's it
production cost is that the twelve and a half
think You also have a remote controls with a lot of options that
that we lose about ninety percent of those options so
and teletext is become outdated since the popularity of internet so the
so the teletext option Maybe we have to skip that one not
and it's on your computer it's on your television so you want buttons are
to the remote control should only be used for a television so that's maybe
And the forty plus people or torture
The new product should reach a new market this custom and our do you wanna forty so it should be flashy
Lcd doesn't work for twelve and a half euros
not an don't think it's very usable a remote control especially
remote control especially when you only have tv function on it
required because it like in a mobile phones usability is not that good
But some of you something to read about speech recognition about
recognition about you said one and the television turns on one is that which
Only the numbers only numbers for the more nothing but only the numbers want to twenty that should be
to work them and does it have to work only in english or in dutch do or
doesn't live in the centre of the room and you can use screen from wherever
Maybe maybe it's too hard to realise that we have short time to
we have short time to put it on the market so that
We make can make it we can make the on the remote control for a fraction of that
i don't think it's use fallen off to take the efforts to design something with the speech recognition
and also if you have a good speech recognition you can just throw the and
A a someone says give me one cocaine the tv turns on a two one it's not
right moment and then you say a tv channel one just one but
because that's very hard for speech recognition
but i don't turn kids just arrange use a knife
to put on do we make a light under the and the numbers anything do if you press
do if you press something that lights up for a few seconds and you can see what
Maybe just as an optional like we discussed like ipod different colours
normal be put in the simple buttons on the top i'm probably the
you have the use teletext you can press a green a red button to go to the next one or two ago could prove as
are very easy that goes to the standard buttons we just have so little
But but maybe you can put the good the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control because
teletext options are only four buttons
but the younger people more often used the internet and elderly
internet and elderly people often use teletext so
many buttons the design is most important you can do integrate
you can do integrate the buttons in the design very much
Because the data simple buttons if you put the one above
for the going to have an orange Lunch break
we're finished with for this time and spongy
