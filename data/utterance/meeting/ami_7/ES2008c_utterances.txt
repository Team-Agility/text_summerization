so conceptual design meeting and it's sending
and it's sending it out's only fourteen twenty five and
twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again i'm so
a minute or if you the minutes of the last meeting then we'll have your
the know how to make a decision on the remote control concepts
concepts panel close
opening armed bizarre
armed bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target
we sat our target group it is a hoax who can afford it would because we have
international be on we said but for all age groups different functions of it objectives were
mean objectives were simplicity and fashion and
a specific functions to keep the remote from getting lost a large buttons for the essential functions a possibility for extra functions like a sliding peace And the limelight battery or charging station
that like to do it in this order first to the conceptual specification of components properties and materials and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching
i a lot of fun doing it components design
a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of
so we need to examine each element separately but we're designing
a whole the main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as or the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery these are all things that we
we can do there's a shape of a case we could do a flat which flat case the curved case or it maybe even a double curved case haven't
that in mind that these are the options that we have for manufacturing and we can make our
and we can make our case out of plastic them the main this'll be plastic but we have
be plastic but we have all these fashion in technological elements we can add in the word latex titanium or rubber or other coloured types of plastic
for buttons we have push buttons which is
push buttons which is what real reaction uses the most often but we also
which can have integrated push buttons or we could go all
high-tech in have an llc d screen
circuit board and chip we can have a simple one a regular one or an advanced one depending on what are
and then the battery is worse things get most exciting were talking about long
we can have your basic double a batteries but we also
but we also have these options of using the kinetic battery like
kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches where you just have
so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery or
solar battery although there are slight complications with solar battery says and
with solar battery says and we can use a latex cases if we have a solar battery
they only described as the type of battery you find in porches from about fifty years ago flashlights not quite what that is
that i receive so that's what i passing on to you so those are options
here's what we've been talking about all through fashion and simplicity so if we're going for fashion
so if we're going for fashion in our cases that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or double curved case probably with a variety of design elements maybe
some word we're gonna have to investigate that better one i specifics of the actual materials that what
probably push buttons but i'm it intrigued
but i'm it intrigued by the idea of the scroll wheel if anyone has anything
i know the ipods and things right now have touch scroll buttons which are exactly
and i'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery solar i don't think would
because how often are you that your remote control get a certain amount of a light But
But this idea of the kinetic that you don't have to replace and
to replace and a simple to shaking around will make it work that
but we also wanna go for a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs
down we're only need a regular or advanced chip if we're gonna start using an lcd so we want
It's double curved like would that be like two hands time
Some imagining like double curved is like like two sides that curve gonna
that curve gonna make one curve would just be like a single word looking thing but i have no idea
I know if we do have a double curved case it can have any titanium in it
But the titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used
hard to us as being used in the space program so that
a broken question on the weight of these different elements have
I'm assuming That's a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and at the titanium
I've saved it this in the shared project so if anyone wants to look and i have
i have considerable notes on the topic as if anyone needs any more information
but if anyone has a specific question some has to email me
know were concepts of user interface
And sent and that is gonna be the concept of the user interface list of device
we've talked about it's a bit too essential properties of the user interface we wanted to be
we've also got a member of that this is the device itself is useful purpose we
we want people to be able to use it as a remote control so we need
so we need to determine what the essential functions of the device r and make
and make that we include that we've included all of our is and that we actually end
and that we actually end up with the device that is going to be useful to people
We have the number of different choices for a design concept and start
and start something that or show you some examples of
but essentially we need to choose how is this device going to work how
what model is a going to be for user interaction with this device one
one switch i was in concept for its week and then design the features of on the concepts making that we
making that we get all the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features and
we don't want lots of buttons complicated features we want something
simple device this is an ipod from apple
the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons it's very
it's very minimalist taken this design ri uses
ri uses for buttons to me to move around so range of settings so on a small lcd screen
It's very quick to access the main features are you can just about
are you can just about make up to our that it's the bottom three buttons are of previous track next track and play pause that the main
that the main features of the ipod the things you would use all the time
then if you want to do anything more advanced you go into the little menu on the lcd screen and
and see you use the buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features you want something
if you're watching tv in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons which are not
So i like like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often so you'd needs
so you'd needs a few buttons to select your favourite channels most
most people when i watch tv they have two hundred fifty channels on the tv and watch
so you have buttons for your favourite channel changing the volume
which is something you do all the time when you're watching tv and the button to switch
and the button to switch off in case you get bored
other features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the tv
there's no point having a television that you can tune all that you can set the contrast so we need to find
and one of the suggestions that make is to aim is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
we do they have a small lcd display on the device itself or
or a have a just a menu display that comes up on the television and
up on the television and be controlled through the device and that would allow
and that would allow you to access the advanced features are was
are was keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for all the features that you use most of them
and the advantages and disadvantages if you have an lcd display
because it's it lets you just sit there and stand control the television from your armchair
and an lcd display would have to be quite small
it it to be tend to watch tv in the dark but
the dark but you need to be able to see your ltt lcd display
Alternative is to have a an onscreen display on the television be control for your remote control
box is where you press buttons and it comes up with the
as if you've got a small tv and it's sitting on the other side we thought of it a little text comes up
I do think that one of the important features for a remote is seen a menu and seeing what's on
Like favourite channels is applicable but you do
but you do need to have some function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description of like i
we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the vcr i've understood you could rather than menu as what's on
i'll be more specifically digital box
it's something to bear in mind is that if we put the display on the remote control communication is one way
one way you can't have the television send information back to the remote control list i don't think i'm not
I know of moving on to market Acting
summary that was market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted and then also
and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan comments on some things that are gonna be go on this year So first
So first they had people they blinked on the important aspects of a remote control and right
and right now it that they're saying that currently there is a functional look and feel preference but that
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes that just
The whole designer of our real reaction company wind focus on fashion and
even know were stressing more talking we then talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea they're mine has
they're mine has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel and
look and feel and as these are range the top one is double important to the second one which
Even though this coming from as as trendwatch market research i don't
also considering that research has been carried out by real reaction a little have the tent as to like how these questions a bit more data and
data and if necessarily this whole fashion and just technology you eat it easy to use is necessarily the right drinking personally
reverse it but if we're working this company that i there are what we have to stress fashion the most but
it you have any ideas had it possibly use these and how to use a fruit or vegetable or or the spongy material think
make a spongy remote would be easier on the hands
would have to find a way to protect like the chip now i
hit my understanding of old latex cases that it's hard to protect inside but it's covered with the
but it's covered with the latex it's a spongy
latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands
It's there's something to be said we got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to Are are repetitive stress injury is and things and
think i'm envisioning more like the material like you have when you said megabytes of also it doesn't hurt
it doesn't hurt you say have one time i am imagining
that given the list a matter of i was for that it's that seems to a ball
Could we go in fruit and vegetable colours we could colour currently
couple main ones being like and lemons or stripe there have been
I It is it's best to be shaped like a vegetable or like i don't like a carrot source
Maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits
I see like a round remote instead of like a rubber button down one like in terms of holding it like that so if she to a fruit
be harder press a button
when you when user remotes you press the buttons where you're from you
I may be want something that's shaped like a mobile phone so you hold it in
one and when you press the buttons are fun
They have to attend a certain amount of space and
what i'm pressing buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press
hand and you press the buttons are fun and
or it and use my thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll wheel
And you press the centre button that's your all
that's your all purpose select a button right there
When it may be good for us is like you could have the same we'll fact for like channel flipping and then the other white could be like for but like
so few buttons remain things but then i go back
i if we would one on the screen there are on the actual tv i
tv i them wanting to say on the tv
on the tv if you're changing the brightness on trying to see it happening and
the lcd screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
also you would be looking down at the lcd screen then back up at your tv and people
we have with fifty minutes left so
presentation i have one more slide before we close but in that side
Good Could we can we have changeable covers like for your mobile in different fruit and vegetable colours
Any more information on fruits and vegetables have to haul
and they pick a first could be spongy latex where but the
and the packaging it's like the po so instead of opening
so instead of opening a box you just peeler in the remote
peeler in the remote control so
the components concept of energy Chip on print
to sit this is a lot of energy i'm thinking is based on a battery
what do people think about this kinetic battery idea
that would Probably take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries
any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery but
i got a bunch of information on how should report are produced there are
there are there certain fibreglass with copper wires and shown to them and
and that they're quite easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print
which chip-on-print as that machine prince on the wires and source it all together for us i don't really know
but i maybe if we decided on like a simple a regular or advanced chip maybe
i got simple regular advanced chip-on-print the chip-on-print
chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor so we do not about
if we're gonna have pushbuttons the require a simple chip but
a simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip in an lc
in an lcd requires advanced do we wanna scroll-wheel
the volume how useful be for changing the channel you don't have
you really need buttons changing the channel
if there's an onscreen menu of your channel traces then you can scroll down on the scrolling
But if you could scroll through the channels and the volume would just be
We have five minutes left of the meeting so
And the volume or just be like the same way forward backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker looking And otherwise
And otherwise no matter how many buttons we have are in have like black with red sitting on that though it's gonna
that though it's gonna know really start looking like Was group of so what we want so these are stacked up
When you get on the on screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll-wheel to go through those menus
so we could either go with a simple a regular chip depending them a
depending them a week at a buttons and for later
when we going to be the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface we have to decide on whether i have a scroll or not
i'm kinda like in the idea of latex if spongy is the end thing
about it because i'm worried about protecting on the inside
i would be more with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone thing
what i've seen just not related to this but of latex cases before is that it there's a like a hard plastic inside it just cover with the latex not too fickle
not too fickle a or latex just have to be cripple ball like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard
i don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board that's
and probably in colours maybe free vegetable colours
interface and we'll come back to the chip i suppose
the interface the tape and the supplements
And if we wanna keep a cost we should just go for push buttons then
simply it's cheaper to make pushbuttons and it is a scroll button so in terms of
so in terms of economics it's probably better to push buttons
And if we have a skin on screen thing you could scroll through like you can use your buttons to scroll through things that
for channel surfing a scroll an actual i got ipods scroll thing would be too fast I
information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then the pushbutton but it's gonna
it may be better to put our money into the like the kinetic battery in the cold case
i assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons we can use
So we have like a menu button so that we can access on
so we're doing it on screen menu then we can scroll through
On off volume favourite channels and the menu
a radio tapes or is the duration
you can just hold it down when you get a one liner scrolling through
of button but the volume control could double for that
our next meeting starts in thirty minutes a new
minutes a new type things you look and feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work together
and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay a get
a get specific instructions from your personal coach
on a chip let's go with the simple chip
