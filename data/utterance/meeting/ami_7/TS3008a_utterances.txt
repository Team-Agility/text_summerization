It's important to place your laptop exactly on the marks for the affair
ideas i if touch the power button
welcome to the kickoff meeting i have forget to put
Examples of the tool training project plan discussion and closing we have twenty five
project aim is to design a new remote control some of the
some of the age i object to started it has to be original trendy and user-friendly
but for you have get the whole quite as part but we will motel are we all know each other names
it consists of the tree levels of design
design we begin with the functional design and we go to the conceptual design and the details assign every level
every level design consist of some individual work and we close it with the meeting you will receive an email
you will receive an email with the example of a explanation of what particular level of design means to the different functions and only you probably
first we're gonna they're gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here so you get acquainted with these and meeting tools we have a smart boards
we have a smart boards that there's those two boards this is
boards this is a presentation boards would do which one am using right now you
there's a docking for cult she to share documents folder you can
documents folder you can upload your or documents to the folder and then you can open over here so you can you powerpoint
so you can you powerpoint presentations on the screen wheels where's the white
wheels where's the white board i
saw us all the files smartboards that's all weeks we can do that
Is an explanation of the smart boards as
simple you at the pen function razor function is like
function is like a very simple page application
and you can make new sheets by but we put the person on the blank button it works like this
and you can change the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing a forward but
pressing a forward but you select and format Yes like current colour or a line width
no your role of acquainted with the different tools
I we're gonna try out the other twenty white board every participant
every participant should draw its favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics on a blank sheet with
on a blank sheet with different colours with different pen widths i'll
i like it's a sharp a razor sharp teeth Plus
Plus the big for has an small on small actual face and i like it so
And so in the format menu you can choose the different colours and pen widths
is but the easiest animal i can't think this is the birds i will
I'll tell us something about the your favourite characteristics of this particular birds
I haven't got a favourite animal to sell all
the weight walks or whatever your turn
You scroll big people sit because of the certainly is
and then we read through the tool training i
this is a something about the project finds the selling price of
the selling price of our remote controls gonna be twenty five euros And our
And our profit aim is fifty million euros very
euros very ambitious on this one The market
The market range of since national so it's gonna be sold worldwide
worldwide and production cost should be a maximum of twelve euro fifty per remote control So that's
we're gonna brainstorm about what can borrow a normal remote controls gonna be
but only about your experiences with the remote controls do you have
controls do you have no good experiences with remote controls were put
are they difficult to understand or Maybe they don't interact with different Like weapons very
I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls but
controls but if you see elderly people all these buttons and then they buy new tv because the previous one was talking whatever and
and then a different remote control with different functions on but from places and half of the functions are remove whatever
A group buttons all the buttons
all the buttons which apply to the text functions in one
or whatever not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control on the button to that to minimise it to this Or whatever are the functions are probably somewhere else we should group
And that is it gonna be a remote control that's what be used for different equipment like your tv and you're on cereal
i was thinking since the tv is mostly used to get the with the vcr or dvd player or recorder and not with a stereo It should be good to include functions for vcr cdv d players recorders
But the edv d players in soon as often double as stereo hi-fi a sense probably swap
for television so we probably don't have to have total that's fine just for dvd player or at least
it's a television remote control but
television remote control
but most television remote controls or the other functions as so we can go
but they're we've got a put some net is uses user-friendliness is a bar it priority this case
this that maybe this some aspect of the or some point it at which we can excel by making a very useful and that we want
useful and that we want then you're the usability and so that's the gonna be a very important task for you then
special like a pd player inside of it or
it or then the production cost are gonna be time problem
As you have to keep it simple to get a whole market it's international so
we can skip back to the goals probably
Original trendy and user faye will also already
and original that it goes hand in and i that something is a regional
the Technical part of the process you're gonna look after four so
four so you have to think about what equipment you want to we want to manage we did One is important
One is important part for you then recorded course to the user friendly part of it
the closing next meeting starts
next meeting starts in thirty minutes individual
individual acting so that the industrial
that the industrial designer will on the working design
the user interface designer or is it the
or is it the user into the user interface the technical
user interface the technical functions design and the management
and the management expert of the marketing expert user requirements pitch can that's what we've
Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach i how much
And it's clear you can put the in the project documents presentations you can all
Project a project documents is for shall not on the whiteboard
but we're all familiar with the microsoft powerpoint
