It's the same as a on the top of it with the river the round button but we don't
we don't we do think it's one of the ease of use which prefers to with the customer of the use of force
I that this device which is a learning curve
novice users you use is device as the normal uses use remote control and for a while
and for a while they start to develop some skills and the voice recognition functions and
like that then it needs to understand what's how to change channels and change the volume so
Good good i see the scroll browse as a shortcut
No wood or grey or black
Grey or black like that whatever cost the cost least
you could use to love them to program the other channels on the two channel button you have
you have to be assigned to channel and channel
but maybe you do want to programme button to activate the voice recognition or train the force voice recognition
I'm a button for and disabling the voice recognition
although by pressing the button for a line two three seconds you would also say it you disable it will it'll beep and they do
There's the basic idea Our product that
That's how the fashion going for the state of fancy
just walk through the star burst up it's
The production costs The costs
it's the way above by law for the twelve euro fifty and what
and what makes it very expensive is the solar cell so
the price the number of items and the some
this is what i would call are a luxury model
if you look at be what we could do to make it more To make it just between the twelve euro fifty
then i It the following changes twelve euro forty
twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving add solar cells
by not using the voice recognition feature because it's a
because it's a four euro addition to the price
most expensive but do at the extra cost so
this design is not Within our price model
because we use push this position the special materials last item i have not at
And plastic and just press a button to pass us out of rubber
It becomes a very dull remote control i know but it's
when this is our only option we should even consider changing casing because
because there's very little added value in advance case with these dole functions so
Type of maybe in our market segments
my maybe not all that fancy but just way more easy basic and the
although we eat we could still make a remote control that up applies more too young people
so it is possible to make it a device that attracts a little bit more too young people
but i agree it's not a fancy high-tech a device definitely not but
But we can evaluate the process and the set section on how things went i'm not
because if we evaluate we can also determine is our objectives are good so
it would have been more fancy if we use the titanium housing the casing it would be
Is not the alternates a fancy tool that
think it could pay more fancy by using the double curved case it would've been even more fancy but
not to because if we use a double curved case we could make use solar cell
Looking at the user needs we only don't we don't have to double curved case we
with the voice recognition feature and
No we are a evaluating this design The spurts out
No it could have been a little bit more innovative you by using the kinetic energy source but it's
the voice recognition and it's hard to learn
but there are two parts in this remote control what you see here
the basic part everybody can use it's so that's easy to
so that's easy to use this for novice user
when you have a more advanced than average user such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions
And it's easy to use for both at types of users
the most important function is easy to use The the zapping channel switching volume
Of the more advanced functions are probably it harder
ease of use does not only apply to the most basic functions it's
right and that but i and it says user will find the voice recognition function easy to use
So that's due to have free to freeze so
but if i would say three and it's six and four is ten Divided by four is two point five
but that's the basic idea of the speaker
something like that maybe have to program it once so to let you respond to a certain word or a certain sentence something like where are you and then it will saying line here so something like that so i
i we should not a state alone on this subject there because of the time but
The feel of remote control is spongy
there are cases in which that outside casing is can be and it's mouldable no it's not that one
because we compare all these cursor it's characteristics with a market with the real market so
there are other remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy there are there Yes but it's not be
Locate the remote controls enough features
it's completely programmable you can add
you can add very much functionality by using the voice recognition on
If you ask yourself bit of an features i don't think It is it has all the features and a normal remote have
That depends on what you implement in the speech feature
talk about it but you do have remote controls that are able to adapt another signal so
you place it a regular remote control in front of the other one hit the one or the two or the three whatever and it records the series dc The signals so you could
so you could a And to any comments you like as long it's able to as long as our device able to reproduce the infra-red signal
So it is a this is remote control with a very high level features although there are
because a regular programmable remote control contains a really a lot of buttons at least forty buttons so
let's give it a number i'll give it a a one for this the type of markets it's a one
of with the voice recognition you could add anything you want so
Yes we've six to sixty in developing a product that's actually quite good but not for this markets and not for this price so
so high quality low acceptance
The product is a high call it has a high quality and this advanced but
but Whether or not our clients are willing to pay twenty five euros for this device is that is what is not But do
what it was a selling price fifty
a selling price fifty at
but it even now if only our production cost work see that's the double
it's not very expensive for remote control that have this functionality
No and original remote control
and original remote control to any tv kind the phillips remote control you pay
it's More than fifty euros it's quite expensive
and i know are from a few years ago it cost a hundred killers
there are a remote controls which control your stereo television dvd cd player for under twenty five euros
but you can learn this thing all these functions and it's easy
to use because those remote controls don't all for voice recognition and this one
we'll go further on what the rest of the evaluation About the project itself not about the product
What did you think about The process the project process
But do we weren't aware of the prices of the costs and that was
deal if we newt that before we could've made the
looking at room for creativity that was to the choice of components was way to narrow so
So we could be we could've been creative that it was tempered by the choice of components and the price
I'm the first meeting we already were very creative we fought
we fought of possibilities now who are not possible with the current all for of manufacturing components so
so too it's it's the laboratory environment i missed it
i missed it and to be able to contact you in between and then say a little a file name
when taking in account the situation nuh we perform pretty
the means the smartboard the digital pen did you like
the digital pen was but smartboard was really
The response is very slow and the possibilities
and the possibilities of very limited it's not accurate
the pointing of the pen is not the place where it drives is
the drawing on the board is that right from the pen
It it was calibrated just before this meeting the one for the third meeting so it's
because it'll want something on the computer i did a type of a sudden
But it's a great solution for and noam problem writing down some notes some is information and then for getting box somewhere and losing all that information because
quite easy it's possible to make this information digital a share
digital a share it with all those quite easy way
i only think it's the shape of the pen is too big it's not quite
i only use it to draw a rabbit sell
i missed a feature to easily select a a slide and distribute it to the laptops that will be
that will be very easy if you could say i want to use this for my own work or my own presentation for the wrong or
if you save this image you can open it in your shared work folder so is almost
Now and the function of a failing and and oval or an an object
An object Where's the drama cut
the drama cut capabilities are very limited
And and that you're when you're using when those you're used to a certain interface and saddam buttons which you can use for drawing and a lot
we all know what's the redesign should be a simple dole
a simple dole one colours box
It's a giraffe eating Using these from a tree
So you actually promoting bluetooth or blue tongue
That is it's a new feature next to bluetooth To disable all bluetooth devices
No Is that sends a bottle of champagne
