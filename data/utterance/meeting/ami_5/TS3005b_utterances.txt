they were already our functional design meeting and
the opening which we're doing now and a special note i'm project manager but
i'm project manager but on the meetings i'm also the secretary which
the secretary which means i will make ten minutes a set of the
a set of the previous meeting and also
and also put these as fast as possible in the project folder so you can see
good and we was to look at new project requirements if you haven't heard about them yet and we have to take
and we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we
and we have some more time forty minutes but we will
want to explain the working design of the remote control is
remote control is possibly very handy if you want to the design one of those
it's works as i in a row down in this no summary when press
when press button Others mean do pro of example when you what's turn up volume the the connection is made the rubber
the rubber button just press on that
which is man's beneath those the plastic or rubber button sense that
sense that connection has been make a note
and knows what button you pressed big the volume up volume down button and
and the chip makes a morse code like a signal which
and that makes the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television
which has a sensor it in its to send so the signal of the infrared
the findings i found searching up some minor detail information about the remote controls are that they are very easy to produce the
speech as possible to make the mass production because
production because the disease it is as easy as a reading a page
reading a page just fibreglass the play-doh and use be is cover with some recordings and And chips and the technology
we don't have to find out how the remote controls have to work or how
or how to our to make some chips that are possible to to transmit those signals
a little Animation of know how it and i were to remote controller works
subcomponent i suppose that you and so on so called this for in this example it's the button
what is press down the switch is there is is switched on so with
so with the wire it is sent to the the chip in cooperation with a battery because
that what after it's being compose but the chip the signal that is transported to to the infrared bulb and from that it signals
from that it signals a morse code like signal to the to look into a bolt in in the television set
i wrote down some personal preferences about the remote control of
control is very handy is the remote controls hand-held so you
i personally breath prefer that's a good for come available and affairs colours and easy to use buttons but i suppose of the one
And as possible for several designs and easy to use but for each use buttons that
buttons that touch at the screen the buttons because
the buttons because the rubber buttons are always they slightly they can be slightly damaged so the numbers
damaged so the numbers on the buttons are not possible and to read anymore and
my name's kim young and i looked
kim young and i looked at the technical functions design of the remote i get this by
i get this by looking at examples of other remote control so how the the look and information from about that i found
what i found was that the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to the television at how
and this can be all sorts imagine it's just turn it on
change the channel adjust volume
adjust volume that standing up if you get
if you use it your cd player the remote control as as some like samples
as some like samples of remote controls you can see they're very
different the one that's got all the functions that you could possibly need them a lot of buttons etcetera any
any other is more user-friendly the middle it's a big buttons and
i you could better but you should look at the user centred so approach because
and if they don't think it's usable they want to buy a lot of buttons anything
personal preference is simple remote with the basic functions that you can eat you could use but
but i keep in mind the new functions of tv what we discussed earlier split
earlier split screen and is that the function that you should have because all
we have one that and that doesn't defeated the video it could also work with with the stereo because
the stereo because place play and stop and you could you
an thing and it should be a user friendly clear buttons and not too much
because it just discuss the functional requirements of the remotes that
that means that Functions use an want to have from the remote control or
The method i prefer these are going to look which section of users we're going to focus on a more
Are the younger people going to buy a remote control elderly people and that but that
and that but that section we're going to focus and adjust
going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section then the whole User
younger people from sixteen to forty five years or more interesting a few features like lcd screen speech recognition it's either And the
And the process about to the market from in that range of h the elderly
the elderly people from four or five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features and we process
and we process less than two thirds just to fifth of the market share in that area
Findings fifty percent
fifty percent of users lose their remotes often so we don't have to make a
so we don't have to make a very small like a mobile phone but some
something but some a bit bigger than small so you don't lose
Thirty five percent of users also find it id and feel
feel seventy-five to use zap a lot so the buttons
Important issues about the remote
about the remote it would be better with the person reference but remote control has
remote control has to have a low power users because
power users because it's what Seventy five percent of the users only said one time in our solar power
in our solar power use is also one time an hour so we high power
Volume button in detail but so the two most important buttons on the remote control so those that
control so those that those as to what we find very easily and have to
It has also we have to find easy when the label is gone my you call it also
if it's got a if that's the problem you also have to find it easily
Buttons slide while can accept have to be minimised
screen lcd screen it's easy to set of
it's easy to set of d screen you have affairs options put one option and then
put one option and then you have all the buttons of that option so to other
option so to other options would be go out and you don't see the buttons
so lcd screen should be easy
But an lcd screen a problem the lcl cd screen is that elderly people from forty five four six five years don't use the lcd screen a lot so we
so we have to get keep that in mind that if you're going to implement lcd screen don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use
lcd screen as in the screen
The last but not least younger people are more critical about features because they use
more often and are more technical than all the people and all the people
and all the people spend more money And you see on the remote control to
to have to keep in mind to focus not a lot not that much on the younger people also
people also somewhat on elderly people And our
And our personal references i don't have any more time to go with that but i at
but i at lcd screen it's easy to use because
easy to use because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote you not that much buttons
And it should be easy to use especially the phone models channel buttons and the number buttons to set to the channels
i and everyone we see the email with the new project requirements no
teletext that's has become outdated since the popularity of the internet So that's
So that's the first thing we we should pay less attention to teletext the remote
the remote control should only be used for the television otherwise project
otherwise project becomes more complex which endangers
which endangers the time to market and we make
our current customers are within the age group of forty plus new
plus new product should reach a new market with customers are younger than forty you
last point but also very important our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products which means
which means that's our corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design so we
according to our again that and then time to take a decision on the remote control functions
basics them i have volume and channel one til to see role numbers on that
a button where you can change from one number two members you
it's it's easy to implement the button we discussed what with respect to do that because
respect to do that because some tvs if you press that is one and then the tool it be between five six to make twelve and
know that and and draw some models that down so accommodate that function so
the of the for the television makes possible and that to the press one and then to make to reach and twelve but
but all television makes the use of those button when you first press the button and then press two digits to get
Of main targets hr work for five plus or
new product should reach a market with customers are younger than forty and now
than forty and now we have current customers for the buttons
because Week younger people was
The younger people i have no sixteen to twenty five hr of a new one percent interest an lcd screen
One point six thirty five sixty six percent and thirty
and thirty six to forty five fifty five percent so
Because almost a remote control so that print plates will be broken number two years have to
years have to press very hard to go to this year with the ld screen it's easy
with the ld screen it's easy because you only have a wide
because you only have a wide screen to for fingerprints and they can use it again
but that that collides with our mission to make it very cheap as l
cheap as lcd screens a very expensive touchscreen
it's possible to make your lcd screen i was the information
it only says that this pursuit percentage like lcd screen
be see and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical
perhaps we should focus on an lcd screen
because our target is sixteen to forty five
And the wheel we not Icsi they are are a production
costs here only half percent which is
or because it only directed the tv then you only have any i what you want to do with the lcd
lc screen just like like a drum it
if you want to the minimal use a button so just channel and volume just this place for buttons on the screen and it's possible
you can adjust which buttons you want on the screen
if you want to just like for trouble just audio settings press only on the touch screen you get the buttons
touch screen you get the buttons for part of that to other buttons are gone
I'm hoping that when we produce a lot won't be too expensive
i suppose is if the markets are It's a it is the young people are
is the young people are interesting us d screens we should make them a that
a that is are the market share to in our goal to deal of those remote controls
But do you all said that we should not only focus on the younger people also me
forty six to forty five to thirty two percent and
two percent and sixty four fifty six a six five twelve percent but our
but our project requirements are the new product should be a reach for new market with customers that are younger than forty
but market share for four years ago were hired and sixty five in your
is if it does get too much too expensive then we should be sticking to rubber buttons
that they will send you some information about the cost of lcd screen so
i should we pose that in our project now folder
But that's easy that's a back-up plan that we would use
they have seventy five percent of users find them ugly
and eighty percent of the users would spend more money would in a remote would look fancy
That it'll look fancy with the lcd screen
It looks fancy one aml cd screen
this the player remotes not specific lcd remotes
maybe you can make something fancy out of an lcd remote because it's new
lot but that's not a special or the lcd screen Only thing you have to do
Only thing you have to do was what the screen off once it's time to get all the fingerprints of it
The most important things on the on the remote control r channel selection volume can selection
And power so power usage
Machines you put a button of fourteen text on the for people want to use it
The remote quite a big remote that you have to fit i
we could make an a separate menu on the lcd screen with the text
And on or less important things are screen settings audio settings and channel settings but
like that i also important to make it possible to make an on an english To not use batteries and use
because the len lcd screen you run it on batteries there is a
power supplies one of the most important things
that she should be able to switch that control if you have an lcd screen
if you have an lcd screen that brings old town no
of those that's for extra but you have first to turn the remote on and then you
so is better than the tv sets down the remote should spend
before an hour when it's good to a given that it's handy they have plenty
they have plenty of time to recharge its of put
because we're watching tv you're zapping you have to put in a recharger don't
But you also forget to buy batteries and then you can you
it should be a standard move to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television that's also
more use you are obliged to put it in the charger and that's too early really a couch or a between some cushions
But they also have to sit have somewhere where you can put a remote recharger your couch because
because otherwise you have to walk all when you two of one to turn on the tv
And is just a cable or even a charger we can man and something like that just you
It has to be easy to use also or four days the market share speaker speech recognition
Functional designs for the le you could make it possible to a large the screen to make
to make it possible to not display a button at ten points or
that's for the standard motion button large buttons
Because we can look at perhaps forty buttons a screen but the
Speech recognition and other than twelve euro it's
other than twelve euro it's twelve euro fifty
twelve euro fifty
that's also ninety one percent to sixteen to twenty five twenty six thirty five years seventy six percent or thirty six to forty five thirty five percent
and just put a microphone top on the television set
But they want to talk into it or a remote control something or
would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control so the things that
the lcd screens should use of sufficient
Speech recognition was even higher
a llc d because in the area of to thirty six to forty five we have about three percent of the market share it in our hands and
and fifty five of those people want lc squared thirty five
c squared thirty five for speech recognition so
I i that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty is that
Then you all sorts of different languages and we go international than
international than that Yes yes they do a french and dutch in the age
It really is that a as an option if we have the money left
i've written down on a on off button volume selection channel selection the digits from one to zero but from zero to nine on digits a button to switch between one and two digits mute button a separate menu for teletext a battery indicator we're going to use
we're going to use a docking station and the probably lcd and
probably lcd and if there's enough money speech recognition and the
and the possibility to in large buttons large buttons
that when you press the red button you go to page one on the to the latest
should we call that we can also do that you said the screen settings and channel setting but this submenus
The main if you do in the remote control you have to see one til zeroed channel volume and
and if you want to use teletext screen or do they can press it should
so not too much the text supports a separate menu button
If you want to use teletext it was teletext button and then the options become available
I would say that one or controls technical functions
wide screen high screen different things to have different
Here's should be stable but that is that the screen settings
so we should also in france the screen settings
screen settings audio settings
screen settings audio settings teletext settings you have
you got you why screen television you don't need the the screen settings for
with the television does not support such as operations
or it could be possible to have a standard version of the remotes nx ten decisions
Colours the main colour of the remote control is so the colour lcd screen he because
Because how many percent eighty percent
Would spend more money if it looks fancy
Twelve euro fifty
If you press a button to the screen
read then we have separate menus for teletext screen settings audio settings and what else
otherwise you have all those did experts teletext months but
Or like you have a menu button you pressed what
we said teletext also separate menu
what was that a menu button push menu they have
push menu they have the main use it you all the settings
so we're having a general menu with the most used functions teletext screen settings audio settings channel settings and
and maybe they're options for the remote itself like large buttons are small icon so
like you have it would have channel button the volume button does
But they don't need a special we do need a special options
we do need a special options menu for the remote itself
mean settings buttons are settings options for the remote control
But there's the idea to use the what you said the normal on off button for a tv but you don't have to use
it otherwise it's it comes to standby mode automatic
but not for the remote control or the tv that you use
the tv the that's the that's the best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel no
But i'm not as normal button in the lc
Or maybe they should be a separate button apart from the lc because you can
lc because you can turn it on when the lc is off saudi
turn the thing unless we are on button on remotes that
i where it's handy to have on a normal on button every just a rubber for tvs are you
can turn it on and then you can choose channel otherwise you
in normal button on the remote control or not
because it when you touch tsd screen where it is in standby mode it should pop on
i if you use the lcd screen you for to sort where's the on button menu and
on but if you have a normal on button on the remote then you do down and then you switch to
but the remote control if you pressed that the screen it always should jump to the screen which has to fourteen button channel button and all also the on off button
it looks a lot more fancy can use you don't have any buttons on the second remote control
that's might be a unique selling point for a remote
That's a problem for the discussion to the next meeting because we're running out of time
And then i will we half hour forty an x share of individual work i will
i will right to the minutes if create an office and
and put them in the project documents folder in here are the
in here are the individual actions for the for their roles and
and specific instructions will be sent to you again by your personal coach
