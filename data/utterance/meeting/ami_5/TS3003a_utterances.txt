and you all have far as the microphones to record your voice And
Is our project documents folder there's some
there's some notes in it already i see some documents i'll start
i'll start with the presentation kick-off
I if you've noticed that we're working for real reaction it's a
it's a company and that rolex we put fashion in
we put a lot of effort in design then in the product itself and
manager so i'll direct you through the project
we have our opening acquaintance tool training project plan discussion closing
is you can see it's the opening acquaintance tool training this is
Kinda paid much attention to that but
but on the corporate that information side there's that there was real remote instead of real reaction Real remote
Real remote is not really the company we are but
our project aim is as you can see a new remote control it has to be original
it has to be original trendy and user-friendly so these are
we've got the marketing expert for the trendy and user-friendly look then the industrial
then the industrial designer there's also user-friendly in the middle region
And we've got our user interface designer It's also
through first functional is it design individual work meetings off to the
off to the functional design then the conceptual design and the detailed design
And industrial designer it is going to work on the working design components design and a bit of the look-and-feel design the
the user interface designer is going to do that technical function design user interface concept user interface design And the marketing
And the marketing expert has them a little bit of user requirement specification trend watching and project the product is evaluation So
Then we've got their first tool training We're going to work with
We're going to work with a lot of high tech tools here so it's
in the white board here is a little tool bar on the side Here's
a blank you document for each person
select the pen razor
then you've got our pen This pen it really funny because you
it really funny because you control with on this page in the it is form of you can also select
you can also select the current colour and the line width but the first you have to select
but the first you have to select the pen function as we going
it's easy to draw your findings and drawings on there
project so the project documents
so if you have a document you wanna show just open it from the folder
so that you said save print Move back or forward one page you can switch
as you can see you all i had to draw animal to just to get a bit familiar with it
The variance anybody playing with the month
child because if you hold it like this sensors will get blocks and
slow but if you going to draw that really fast and then want to hold up so
we choose for math current colour
My greatest it characteristic about and off and this for a firm so
no i'm gonna hand of the pen On the new blank sheet to you go
Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width because is going
Little blue dot they always could spread on their butts
It's a past time to our user interface designer
so if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the whiteboard just lost can go ahead
go ahead It's pretty easy
Move along to the project finance
As you can see me for a remote control a selling price is at twenty five euros our selling price a profit
a profit aim is fifty million euros
that's the least we have to get from a remote controls so we have to work together
so we have to work together to reach our aims
so we have to focus on different users different cultures and different trends as
Our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half euros so that's also
that we want to make a remote controls with small televisions inside and like that
just try to remember these points selling price twenty five profit aim is fifty million but more important is that an international market are trying to focus on and production cost a natural twelve and a half euros
you've got about five or ten minutes left for a discussion So
So just on the side not wise of my laptop as given me a black screen
does everybody so experiences with remote controls and the ordinary remote controls but also a little bit different ones like you can use for other No
Kinda but tv at home and a dvd player so
we got like a lot of remote controls one for the tv one for the v recorder one for the dvd player And it's
And it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all
home and you can a program eight different devices in it and you can use it for a television
so you have for the other little device inside your room and then you can operate
So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder a dvd player downstairs and you've got a link to your tv and the second for so that's a pretty handy
that if you can put different devices in one remote control That makes that all these years that's
but i if that's all exceed the production cost so that's
And other functions for a remote control
Think sb shock proof
My remote control tends to fall a lot
i will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder
thing but it might be handy to put the battery state is display on it
any questions about this a presentation kick-off presentation
then i'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder
then i'll need to in about a half an hour So good luck
