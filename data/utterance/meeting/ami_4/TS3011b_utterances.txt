Is there any time for a cup of coffee Can i get a cup of coffee
We have a slight problem I opened
I opened the cd rom box that's
the remote work i have no time either so
i open cd rom box accidentally That's alright
people welcome back with the second meeting
seconds i received some new project requirements i'm not if you
then the three if you prepare the presentation so stand
the top goal of this meeting is to reach decision on the product on the target group and the functions of the remote control so
about it but we should not support teletext in the remote because
because are board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet
and the internet is replacing teletext so
remote control should only be used for television because it's not
the third requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger than they have forty which is important
and it should be bought by people younger than forty
Therefore go as important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call
our products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
i've the goal was a boston move you would like to start
we they discuss is already in this in the previous discussion the
the method of the remote control is just a function of remote
just a function of remote control is to send messages to the television set
So that was The main important thing what a remote control should do And i found
And i found that are two different remote controls the multi function
the multi function and remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
and ease of use remote control with the last possibilities a great feeling in touching the buttons
My personal preference where ease of that use remote control Because the user
Because the user friendliness and it can be more trendy in and use design but
but your new goal for was for people than less than forty years old so maybe
so maybe the multi function and can be implemented in in our design but
but it should be it should be a combination but teletext buttons
but teletext buttons are not in our design so it should
but not as in my opinion the it be easy to use rc is the best one possibility for us
Just for a for used is user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control
all this device has to do is to send messages to tv set and
and most easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the tv set i was
there is connected to free things user interface
user interface connect to chip which is connected
which is connected to the sender which generates
which generates messages using infrared light which
usually these things consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip set a circuit boards that's all
It's almost every piece of equipment Every piece of every tv set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions
and the more luxury a remote controls and let them buttons and i
The on the dark concept we discuss
i have the basic scheme of things which are implement
the rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected
there are few buttons connected the buttons
and the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared light diodes and there's not a
So that's the total design of this piece of equipment that's not a moderate
personally we should infer use infrared because
because otherwise our device can have communicate with almost every tv set so
at another important point is that we really should use energy sparse friendly components they're
they're specially designs and energy friendly components which
components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components and
and if we want to use a rechargeable design or energy save design we should really implement them
for cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board and
and because most the production cost rr in just a part of the equipment and
and the money we say if we using this we can use for an average fancy lighting and techniques blinking lights and all that fancy our
Combined with the low cost circuit boards this
could only let's the buttons the use most so that channel switching
but the question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques i
it's the same as in cell phone just one like in the device that size and all the buttons and not for
we what we are very career curious to of the market We'll feel about such a product
then i'm that the target market is to tell million units
Of some of which we should sell about to forty percent to make the five million
But since the old part is forty percent of the market i
i older you might want to constrain that portion market but
see that's still true but in use ten percent the buttons the
the buttons to use that are used about fifteen hundred times when the
when the power buttons and use one time and the volume
so they of use the the most important button And there are lots of people
And there are lots of people complain they kind can find the remote controls so
remote controls so we might want to build in the future to support them Some audio signal like one phones
Or a find the finding function
Volume and the zap buttons are mostly used so
she would just have a design Perfect design for those only those buttons the first
there's no but i wrote technique a used in this equipment so
so we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really what the market needs so
so maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and sound signal
thing i'm just wondering Some signal from where do you execute the this in south I know
that thing in your hands like a turning on and off the light
there are some devices to incorporates this technique already and
already and our video sets and and there's a special button that find the remote control button you press it and your t
you press it and your tv set starts to make a weights out and your remote controls
and your remote controls and start a beep and
Reports or to spend response to it
We do not control the tv set so
And even if the tv set would have such a button you would have to walk you tv Is
I'm convinced sebastian will find the one solution for us
because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds
see the line in light of lightning
take a restriction the characteristics of clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound which is
which is generates a few times within that a certain period of time but any other
but any other sounds which aren't exactly the same from the point if you all from remote control
So if you'd be watching a movie it would can see beep
But we can have just a home station for base station next to see this a little antenna if
I don't think people would bother walking to tv and press that button because they are lost the remote
the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some online And then the remote control reports itself so
something like that you do not want another device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find first before you can find your remote control
Just a base station next a tv is a bus with nancy
maybe we do agree on the thing that the remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that things maybe sebastian
maybe sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution because that's
Yes but before i do that all i want to one you that by implementing this a function the technical design will become more complicated and
And do we even are you sound above the the let's the lightning Function
because when you have the newspaper over your remote controller you cannot see it so
It will be a unique feature of a remote control
And that's about the user interface i come up with And easy remote control and the advanced remote control what should
according to read it people do not use all the extra features very often so
wise board so i'm not questioning that
channel selection is the most important
so on the relevance scale the channel selection the volume selection and the teletext
just or dec design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons in it so
we should save costs by not implementing a lot of functions and
functions and the money that we can say from that we should use for having a design and thinking about the user interface and
do you think the market would respond to a simple
if we include other in a stiff Functions then they mikes
mikes young people like new features so
We just a few buttons trendy design lightning what and the sound
you can make it look like an easy ease of equipment but it's quite elaborate it's
maybe it's more important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment but
all if you have few buttons know display i it's working with a shift functions and one button can
i was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling by these sticks like that i if it's
i if it's user-friendly as you feel fifties
But but how does how this d remotes are reports it we give back to the user in what state is because
maybe we can use a light for that when you move the stick
when you move the stick to to a position maybe light next to it can it up so
so i've just push a button or change the channel or to not the volume something like
And if you use that stick for volume control and channel selection you have them to most important function In one button
And we could have a other buttons for the advanced other functions
Is just an easier way of a round button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake if they give from
if they give from work for ball When it's fun and down or
just a round buttons should be the truth
use so it'll it attract younger people because of new and
and it might attract all the people because it's easy to use
but we still we're still in the question of and putting in advanced options but
but it's just all those the market is interested in some advanced new techniques
however it keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those things we need to find a
we need to find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness
we need to have the the use of function at the functions decide it and our target audience
Do you do you wanna list of functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all functions available device
but the one the functions the most important or volume and programme selecting
how is the remote going to look not any user interface that
and just one function and the problem to programme button to switch to to channels when you have something and channel four n something on channel six just one button which can jane's
i'd put all the minutes i make into the shared folder so
if you want to go to channel nineteen you only have that button
I wouldn't buy personally Remote control without that and it's and i
Does elder people or would buy it but
imagine when you only have a set like to go there and you have about six on the channels imagine you want is but if you're
but if you're a regular tv user and you just want to watch the dutch television networks you can a kiwi you can use about ten buttons that's enough
And if we are starting at the younger audience they'll probably watch more channels and the old people so
nokia they have ten digits on the phones and
so you can experiment by with a shape or we have sizable with colour that thing
And there are some numbers about the speech recognition here that's younger people would like it it might
it might be expensive and they're hard to implement but it
maybe it can be combined with us find the remote control so
when you add speech recognition to your remote control it's very easy to change the channel that's one thing and it's
thing and it's very easy to find your remote control
That If if we would draw the ten digits but keep the program in
the volume because maybe people do not always want to use the voice
Especially elder people don't like voice recognition so
but we do focus on younger people we'd it's
So we have to make it decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
the voice recognition has the main it stand as not sent it's makes it
it's makes it very easy for us to implement to find remote control button remote control function
this the power saving will be a bit more difficult so we can expect
so we can expect that there will be unless longer life to the batteries but maybe
but it has some a hebrew i bet devices which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries so
so when you just need to device in a light roll it charges itself you have to do
Twelve dollar fifty
And if we could and and to it a cradle in which it could recharge And that wouldn't be a big problem is when
is just a case we have to metal contacts
Yes but they're mass production the very cheap
we have a about ten minutes left this meeting
did you came up with the voice recognition the data are there
just the younger parts off the market isn't the forty percent we Want to sell two
but with buttons like that which are easy to use we my coat rack and two so
so although we are focusing on younger people to make it a profitable we we still need to take in account the bit older people
want to make it a summary of all things are spoken and the different possibilities
we've decided to implement seemingly easy design so on the outside
but we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on your side so that's one
but there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by implementing a speech techniques voice recognition that these kinds of things
and the main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques which
like disadvantages that there are so concerns about the costs and things like that battery lifetime energy saving another advantage
another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more user if we do in that do not implement these buttons
If you just at a chip which just a voice recognition our circuit board will become even more cheap so
and that was the main issue right the board
But the cheaper that the chip or in one of the circuit board
The fewer buttons you have that's the cheaper the circuit board yes
And it's very cheap to incorporate integrated circuit the chip so it's
then we she just take a look at the costs and especially for the voice recognition
I'm not how i will thumb Determine the costs i will
i hope personal coach will wanna have a look at it
out then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform are individual work and i'm
and i'm your personal coach is we'll assist you with it
i will put the minutes made the project documents folder if you want
the interface designer i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the components concept i
i'm user interface designer
user interface designer role i would like to see the user interface concept and
the only problem is it but it depends on the decisions disease up in this since it's the best and makes about the voice recognition
concluded it should be in easy interface with not so much buttons it's just that but at the volume and the programme one and some fancy lights i
some fancy lights that's what we decided
So we drop the voice recognition or
i'm the marketing expert will receive you will do some trendwatching and i'm
and i'm the market will Examples will change adapt and
