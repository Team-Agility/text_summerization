first we have a prototype presentation by gng
evaluation treats criteria
criteria it in combination with findings i i received and an excel file
it and then we must see it we a stay under the twelve and a half euro so
after that in evaluation off the process how we how we have done it you with the smartboard there what are laptops with the All all this and i
and i have to work so we're closing once again forty
was good use the word to gng for the prototype presentation
first house as we decided to use a single touch screen so we've
concepts how to hold it with the buttons and and
and be began with a form of shape the this easy to hold win one hand left or right handed so we made
during the meeting actions you concept of placing about some top usable with that and and the
and and the menu structure if necessary other hand it's
So we began working on a concept
and as we should just have the basic remote with the panel lcd screen
screen this would be the main buttons you could
buttons you could change the matter on the non profile as you want to but
as you want to but the standard they will be delivered with this set up
set up with the mail more advanced menu sitting right here but submenus
we may that top or front view just
front view just like you wanna back to you as it is it
as it is a dn two or weird bumps in this is for the
this is for the edit effect of use and dynamic and the
after that but idea is for just a imbalance with these two ja with these two so
lay down and want our all round of but it will lie
but it will lie a more in your hand like an old telephone maybe or
there is panel it we you would hide with some more rubber layers like we discussed
you which you wouldn't see the states panel but more fluently and announce
But the overlying layer is a little bit curved
where the this and can be held with your hands wood is maximum
battery and maybe even on or an electronic chips so and so you can
so and so you can just be the layer of the touch screen and some of some wires on the need to make it as a thing as possible and no one could quit
the bumps then you can see it as a very it's a useful dynamic exterior
it to you just want to hold it if you were you a young and the dynamic like us
what the old version but this is a like a remote control for children
idea we just want to build a more to the and all that one and old version of this
And then for colours we figured starting of basic colours like why it's all the data grey or some
would be best to appeal to drop public and make the covers exchangeable so young
so young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and purple butts when
butts when they're all are people ago when is shop wanna see an orange remote control it would be less appealing the white one and young people we think
and young people we think are a little bit more flexible our
flexible our by for a couple of your worst sunlight it but
maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover so that you can take a cover in the shop
so i must be some cheap standard cover
and you can buy so we can make extra money
but you'd you mustn't forget that we are targeting this younger people we had decided
we had decided to put some flashy fruity colours in it
and in the surf we from milan and paris it's it came out that the older people are more willing to to spend money on extra futures so
so it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as a standard and
and for the people who are really want more sophisticated more traditional look they're willing to pay that's they want
maybe we could develop a call for with would start Then
colourful we would start a wide and a couple of it for fruity colours and
too much this is a banana mango not purple orange and yellow
but we may the standard must be some attractive flashy colours not too but
except for the buttons as it could be a standard model
During the design life cycle we
We made a lot of requirements and trend the number so some
mouse of time to evaluate our prototype concept to To the past requirements So
So we're going to evaluate a design according to the parts user requirements and trends analysis
Opening a word document now
the remote controls design for people with h below forty
that's not just designed for people on the data for is also designed for people above forty
just other question is and that is it's designed for people with age below forty but
below forty but it's also designed for people right above forty so
it'll be primarily appealing to minus forty bucks also feeling
the remote controls beautiful
that's a marketing angle on television we have two
Of you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your problem
the remote control looks fancy
for the remote control was a big clear channel switching buttons
i'm user interface the experts
at teletext buttons and volume buttons
No teletext buttons teletext is in the menu
it but you could make a teletext button six or was people
or was people read this i don't think we have no teletext button
but the teletext button you could that's in the menu so it's
The remote controls easy to be found
it has is all these fruity colours and as a strange shape it
if you put your normal remote control on their bad all you'd throw this remote control nearby is a better findable
my remote controls black
but we can do it glow in the dark so is it to the dark
so is it to the dark lady still blowing
according to the other remote controls there may the be there in your tv room this one will stand out
if you're a fifteen remotes and drawer you find it
Is it is this lying on your couch or you thing was that for orange so
but the survey on the users was that they a really lost it
i see if you see a strange shape line somewhere and then you would recognise it as or that the stains that
mostly when you lose your remote control is only a
the remote control was fresh fruity colours
used to we've decided not to make to fresh colours is no it's not
The remote controls made of soft material
Just just with ten buttons that's easiest
think should be functionality and a fancy outlook so
It is it is rather easy to use because you have the primary buttons always visible
We also have to compare it to the To remote controls on the market now there so
What's the time we also have to do the evaluation the production costs and
eleven remote controls and all that this
The remote control was a remote with the removable call from north looks
The remote control it is speech recognition is false
The remote control and building games
But maybe make it too because the games are in the submenu and not it's not an umpire again
we have not to to calculate the production costs if it's under
it's got stuck under twelve and a half euro then we can their move on to the project evaluation as we have the experience that or otherwise
we have to fill in the numbers of the compliments of components we
of components we have to one two and do it in and see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro so
Now on funds chip sample sensor
sample sensor sample speaker
no but is it's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then And then no
the lay around that fits the rounds be balls on the the brackets
we now the problem we have reached eleven euro
Actual a special colour
i've reviewed all those feel a type one special colour
i there so we can make it single curved or uncurved
not can i say something as project manager The kinetic
we just put a good battery in a small will force
a small will force nowadays
here what you think about a button a battery in it but also selling like the covers a docking station just part from the
But you can use rechargeable batteries in wages use your three weeks that's the menu
or you can go from the double curved a single curved
And that would solve budget problem
so we have to break the back flat same as
this is just one person and not the back curved right
no advanced produce a little bit of problem
Explanation twelve fifty
So if we did this we are on twelve and a half euro and we're done
single curve but there's a curve in it so
if you make it double curved it cost one euro more but
you make like eleven an hour of euros profit Instead of twelve now but
twelve now but I if twelve miles this fixed the fixed price
but it to the kinetic would be a marketing promotion if you
if you promote kind then like like dynamic remote control that would sell button and a normal remote control
now you can shake your remote control
there you can go and do you never done a mike a remote control is kind that it
is kind that it stand out alt battery control remote
what about all on the n forum and freaks of freaks
but it doesn't fit in a car cost for also
You make a make an end specialised extreme cold version
because if you want to go to kinetic your your a certain a half and you must go to flat and i
And if you make the single curve have just a big curve
Has gone through and Say nasty words but i don't this strange
makes a remote control lot of type a team
It is possible what you can to use double curved for titanium that's one
Now it's about time to talk about this project
were there room for was a room for creativity
was a room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings
But that's mainly because of the information that was delivered to us it was just fixed
has an easy to use especially you and the know you both at the less committed for our roles in the project
your room and i we the more design we could have more we have more room for creativity then you can
the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting
it's a tool i was a i was also very unhappy a very unsatisfied about
better and the last two meetings also we you wear it's some good decisions about the four
consensus and everybody what was a green ring
we work together on the project but everybody has its own task so that's all this
i was more like presentation is some points were discussed that
line of some little bit too small like a big trick or no
after class for the smart board
for the smart board so that's the main issue
The idea is great that's that doesn't work problem
Digital pen i'd follow the first time i did the individual work i use it but out and
as a set of them are few moments ago i would like myself to buy the normal pen because most
it's almost same concept but you can just sit more simply put a dollar scanner use
use the same concept was the pen where you from to download softer was a very all
And it's still your own and writing a open up an a word
we've it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things and that's the
and should try to run once in a in a normal size or smaller
are we tried it was buttons it's almost impossible that we are running so in your
large it was a race this line
it's a big big eraser
the idea of the touch screen is
New ideas about the working of the software for about the project about the remote control so
But the new ideas found for we would working with this software
or much to my type of features lot of your process and
process and it just takes too many time people still
people still feel the need to write it's quickly on a page channels downloaded to say easier
may maybe the idea you propose to use a screen here and draw
or at least when you You don't have to adapt to technologies as you can whites
and now you have to keep calls in the in mind through drawing on the screen and
But if you're a normal flip over your a lot of people white text is not text option
and maybe some functions for a circle or square you have to
just type text that would be a excellent mean
A picture from scanner clipart
We real reaction the open now
a pity if you if you have five thirty forty minutes for this things and we are now
more see the case from here we are with the management you get two minutes to make a case know if you have
You better use powerpoint certain work it out of the files and
is the decision decisions system like
maybe a little application like Give you a number and click one two three four five six seven
just like you said with the screen which you can ride also a floating mechanism
just a little group decision application
But end of the problem is you can discuss anything
but that click it in an application that's a lot easier to process
but then the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it that is not bad idea actually Not
two more the costs are within the budget the project
budget the project is evaluated but
but before we don't celebrate i have a little question which you can't answer because
report i'm busy with and reporter and i know you might thinking what
about all the meetings what we have decided a report
your is a standing we can celebrate now but the report if
you have ten minutes left red
Yes not ten minutes left to finish at the end report
Management expert you have to change
About three functions where which are most used and which most it needs to be visible on a remote control it
it must be simple to use very clear what to do and at the younger people so this is really about
You that you have to put switch channels at the top because that's the most used function and teletext at the second
If the orders in there if it's an important that's a word for
the the energy which turn out to be battery so
maybe you can add later that we decide it's in the end because the cost
a year it is still the double curved the rubber the flashy you fruity the removable
Was an issue look at the initial plan
like that or a snake it's end of the parents control touch screen
touch screen so it's just a summary
One small thing and and it's functions wasn't included in the costs i don't think
no but it's development inside corporation like
like what we don't have to buy parental control our people
What's that what's the company call i'd just keep forgetting
Real real reaction
the decision to make and the buttons on the top and the menu on the
touch screen you've mentioned
but that decisions are put in the conclusion why we decided
why we decided to use a flat the lcd
five minutes from to finish meeting
fake it's like file like sports and then the cp files
So i knew a commercial logo
I'm going to finish my aunt report
and you buy this meeting is finished
you buy the meetings finish
