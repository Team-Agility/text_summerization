everybody i'm glad you get a common really set aside
said i have a powerpoint presentation for us for the kick-off meeting my
my name is rose and then i'll be the project manager
opening and then i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project bob of into a quaint
bob of into a quaint and so just going to know each other little bit including a tool training exercise a normal the
a normal the to the project plan to little discussion
at we're creating a new remote control which we have three goals about it needs to be original
about it needs to be original trendy and user-friendly i'm
i'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those
so we're gonna define this up in the three compact three parts first the functional design
which will be on for so do individual work into a meeting
conceptual design individual work and a meeting and then the
and then the detailed design individual work and a meeting so they want you to
training so we're gonna work that whiteboard behind
and so's to draw my favourite animal i have
favourite animal i have no drawing skills whatsoever but
and i i'm the industrial designer on this project so let's see
I'll draw a little Turtle for you all Not necessarily
Not necessarily it's i have a solution favourite animal but is
quite tech rid of animals they can split they can
And i'm the user interface designer for the project
And Of time for my favourite animal
because of the weekly phone phillies whatever have a good time
i'm rose and project manager From california
It definitely is in the beginning harder wondered do and
i have it on and a very aggressive and open space and off and we have these
thinking in a really beautiful animal person
I would like to sell it for about twenty five euro with a profit aim of fifty million euro from our sales and because this is
and because this is such this is for television at the with the market range of the internet like it's in international market range we do have to worry
range we do have to worry about specifics
in order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro So we're selling it
Just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project it could have like to you by your experiences using rubber remote controls your first
your first ideas about creating a new remote control would be the best
when there's like where some buttons and you have to pass to actually turn on the tv that you have
on the tv that you have to do one for the power the tv in like
the tv in like another one to get actual screen and
going to an hour now we keep combining all different remotes together and
remotes together and then on off a necessarily like that if like to end
that if like to end up to multimedia overload it just wanna watch
I've used that these remote controls things like tv and the cd player and video recorder and
and And i that pretty neat little tools you don't have to
get up and walk across something to change the channel so especially if you're
so especially if you're someone really lazy like mean the print outs
especially like i know if i'm watching tv i have a we separate remote controls of in front of me and one for the tv one for the digital box one for the video recorder as
And also evidence attended a bit confusing they've
to solve complicated supply and
supply and i really wanna do is switch on and off change the channel
on and off change the channel change the volume
remotes around my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things i
And one thing i particularly like is if you're not street moving it around to get it to work with the infrared
that but i know it in my residence right now the television you should have to walk all around the room together to turn on so it's just simple
on so it's just simple are just to just run on the tv itself and that's
and that's if we're gonna make a remote control it should actually work for what it's doing
and things like that like either some remotes that i where Like batteries are to war
they seem to have a little bit of a complex over Did combining all the remotes can together versus having if by different remotes so
doesn't have all the buttons that you need to programme the video recorder or
recorder or programme it's other things that i'm not a coherent about that just has
that just has your major buttons for that work for everything volume control on off
it so it's like if you look if you're trying to get the tv on that note that happen on the remote a number of a beep or a corporate so now in terms of how we're gonna make it but if it's like all the tv set is here then all
all the whatever else programmed into it's all just in a separate place and not like all the on button see a doctor
on button see a doctor know like minimum trained on
and if if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would need to use every day
so maybe have like one remote that has the main function of the on off channel changing volume and at the right remote with all the special things because that
because that is one thing that on remotes ten to have buttons that the tvs no longer have as so like you have
as you can we need a special functions occasionally
that silly on them that normal remote
i ask are we are designing a remote control for television and me
Would leave and technically be possible to include video recorder functions on that
or should we just stick to having television like the buttons on
tv mean if it for taking it does right that's a New product a new television remote control it's not like that doesn't say
So we should maybe we should assume that it's just a television that we want to control
i suppose it would be to have a play in the court and stop buttons on the tvd recorder as and i
Yes i we have to define what or aiming for if it's just a television
if it's just a television on the top it simpler to show us buttons
Large if you have older people
if you have older people or people like me that are fake court needed hand i it's really quite important that you're not pressing a small teeny mobile phones size buttons if we can help it
sounds like we've had a good little session for our first ideas mind if
ideas mind if we move on
our next meeting starts in thirty minutes i believe
believe of actually but only working on this one for about twenty so we continue
so we continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like
But this is just a breakdown of what will be doing individually the industrial
the industrial design only now we doing on the working design
the user interface designer that's real that's Technical functions i like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons on the user requirements
on the user requirements so do we hearing about different runs how about different things that people need
i the same discussion that we've been having we'll get from the actual concern is consumers
and you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach i realised
your personal coach i realised in this past when we didn't have much we just
What we're gonna be discussing and the next meeting the banana
and then because what we're gonna do is first are individual actions and then we'll come back
so I'm we'll have more concrete things to continue next time
what type up make minutes and probably numbers
Can you email your slides as as opposed to
